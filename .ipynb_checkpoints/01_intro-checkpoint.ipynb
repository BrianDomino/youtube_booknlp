    "I am Dr. William Mattingly. I hold a PhD in Medieval History from the University of Kentucky where I explored early medieval social networks. A lot of my research was aided by my ability to code, specifically in Python, for data cleaning and analysis. I was even able to use Python to plot and visualize social networks and data. During the fourth year of my PhD, I used Python to create an app that I could use to plot and analyze these social networks. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Fellow for the Analysis of Historical Documents at the Smithsonian Institution with a joint appointment at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. In both institutions, I use Python, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze historical texts in large quantities to generate new insights about the documents held in the archives. In all, I have nearly a decade of experience using Python as a historian.\n",
    "\n",
    "When I first started to explore Python, there were not many available tutorials geared towards humanists and, for that reason, four years ago I started PythonHumanities.com and Python Tutorials for Digital Humanities on YouTube. I geared these resources to humanists who had no prior knowledge about computing or coding. This new JupyterBook is the third iteration of this textbook that brings a lot of the material that first appeared on PythonHumanities.com years ago into a new, more accessible JupyterBook. It will forever remain free to all as will the video lectures embedded in this book."

    "<a href=\"https://github.com/booknlp/booknlp\">BookNLP</a> is a new Python library created by <a href=\"https://github.com/dbamman\">David Bamman</a>. It was originally created as a Java library in 2014 under the same name, <a href=\"https://github.com/dbamman/book-nlp\">BookNLP</a> by David Bamman, Ted Underwood, and Noah Smith (see, David Bamman, Ted Underwood and Noah Smith, \"A Bayesian Mixed Effects Model of Literary Character,\" ACL 2014). While Java is a powerful coding language, both in speed and ease-of-use, not many digital humanists code in Java primarily. I suspect (I want to emphasize I could be wrong) the reason for the Python library was to address the larger Python-coding community both in general and specifically within the digital humanities. This textbook will deal strictly with the Python library.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the documentation, Bamman states:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"BookNLP is a natural language processing pipeline that scales to books and other long documents (in English), including:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Part-of-speech tagging\n",
    "- Dependency parsing\n",
    "- Entity recognition\n",
    "- Character name clustering (e.g., \"Tom\", \"Tom Sawyer\", \"Mr. Sawyer\", \"Thomas Sawyer\" -> TOM_SAWYER) and coreference resolution\n",
    "- Quotation speaker identification\n",
    "- Supersense tagging (e.g., \"animal\", \"artifact\", \"body\", \"cognition\", etc.)\n",
    "- Event tagging\n",
    "- Referential gender inference (TOM_SAWYER -> he/him/his)\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike its predecessor, the Java library, the Python library leverages the Python NLP library, spaCy, and the Python Transformer library from HuggingFace, rathern than Stanford, to perform many of these tasks. In the last few years, spaCy has proven itself as a dominate force within the NLP community, outperforming many of its predecessors in accuracy and at sacle\n",
    "\n",
    "It delivers in all these areas."
