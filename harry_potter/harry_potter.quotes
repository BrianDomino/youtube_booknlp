1102	1121	1098	1098	they	424	" The Potters , that 's right , that 's what I heard yes , their son , Harry "
1356	1359	1360	1360	he	96	" Sorry , "
1429	1473	1418	1418	he	444	" Do n't be sorry , my dear sir , for nothing could upset me today ! Rejoice , for You - Know - Who has gone at last ! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating , this happy , happy day ! "
1616	1619	1621	1622	Mr. Dursley	96	" Shoo ! "
1708	1712	1684	1684	She	454	" Wo n't ! "
1748	1815	1816	1817	The newscaster	457	" And finally , bird - watchers everywhere have reported that the nation 's owls have been behaving very unusually today . Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight , there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise . Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern . "
1823	1850	1819	1819	himself	457	" Most mysterious . And now , over to Jim McGuffin with the weather . Going to be any more showers of owls tonight , Jim ? "
1851	1856	1858	1859	the weatherman	458	" Well , Ted , "
1861	1946	1858	1859	the weatherman	458	" I do n't know about that , but it 's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today . Viewers as far apart as Kent , Yorkshire , and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday , they 've had a downpour of shooting stars ! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it 's not until next week , folks ! But I can promise a wet night tonight . "
2018	2037	2014	2014	his	96	" Er -- Petunia , dear -- you have n't heard from your sister lately , have you ? "
2063	2066	2067	2067	she	462	" No , "
2071	2074	2067	2067	she	462	" Why ? "
2075	2082	2083	2084	Mr. Dursley	96	" Funny stuff on the news , "
2087	2107	2083	2084	Mr. Dursley	96	" Owls ... shooting stars ... and there were a lot of funny - looking people in town today ... "
2108	2111	2113	2114	Mrs. Dursley	96	" So ? "
2116	2138	2083	2084	Mr. Dursley	96	" Well , I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to do with ... you know ... her crowd . "
2161	2164	2152	2152	he	96	" Potter . "
2182	2199	2173	2173	he	96	" Their son -- he 'd be about Dudley 's age now , would n't he ? "
2200	2205	2207	2208	Mrs. Dursley	96	" I suppose so , "
2211	2224	2173	2173	he	96	" What 's his name again ? Howard , is n't it ? "
2225	2238	2173	2173	he	96	" Harry . Nasty , common name , if you ask me . "
2239	2244	2246	2247	Mr. Dursley	96	" Oh , yes , "
2254	2261	2246	2247	Mr. Dursley	96	" Yes , I quite agree . "
2798	2804	2793	2793	He	108	" I should have known . "
2981	2990	2976	2976	he	108	" Fancy seeing you here , Professor McGonagall . "
3062	3071	3072	3072	she	483	" How did you know it was me ? "
3075	3091	3057	3057	She	483	" My dear Professor , I ' ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly . "
3092	3109	3111	3112	Professor McGonagall	109	" You 'd be stiff if you 'd been sitting on a brick wall all day , "
3114	3139	3057	3057	She	483	" All day ? When you could have been celebrating ? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here . "
3145	3156	3157	3157	she	483	" Oh yes , everyone 's celebrating , all right , "
3161	3192	3193	3193	She	483	" You 'd think they 'd be a bit more careful , but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something 's going on . It was on their news . "
3208	3255	3193	3193	She	483	" I heard it . Flocks of owls ... shooting stars .... Well , they 're not completely stupid . They were bound to notice something . Shooting stars down in Kent -- I 'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle . He never had much sense . "
3256	3263	3265	3265	Dumbledore	108	" You ca n't blame them , "
3268	3280	3265	3265	Dumbledore	108	" We 've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years . "
3281	3286	3288	3289	Professor McGonagall	109	" I know that , "
3292	3327	3288	3289	Professor McGonagall	109	" But that 's no reason to lose our heads . People are being downright careless , out on the streets in broad daylight , not even dressed in Muggle clothes , swapping rumors . "
3360	3400	3356	3356	she	483	" A fine thing it would be if , on the very day YouKnow - Who seems to have disappeared at last , the Muggles found out about us all . I suppose he really has gone , Dumbledore ? "
3401	3407	3409	3409	Dumbledore	108	" It certainly seems so , "
3411	3428	3409	3409	Dumbledore	108	" We have much to be thankful for . Would you care for a lemon drop ? "
3429	3433	3356	3356	she	483	" A what ? "
3434	3451	3409	3409	Dumbledore	108	" A lemon drop . They 're a kind of Muggle sweet I 'm rather fond of "
3452	3458	3466	3466	she	483	" No , thank you , "
3478	3493	3466	3466	she	483	" As I say , even if You - Know - Who has gone - "
3494	3542	3543	3544	Professor McGonagall	109	" My dear Professor , surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name ? All this ' You- Know - Who ' nonsense -- for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name : Voldemort . "
3562	3594	3548	3548	Dumbledore	108	" It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ' You - Know - Who . ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort 's name .
3595	3614	3649	3649	Dumbledore	108	" I know you haven ' t , said Professor McGonagall , sounding half exasperated , half admiring . "
3641	3641	3635	3635	Voldemort	113	"
3642	3647	3649	3649	Dumbledore	108	" You flatter me , "
3652	3661	3649	3649	Dumbledore	108	" Voldemort had powers I will never have . "
3662	3676	3635	3635	Voldemort	113	" Only because you 're too -- well -- noble to use them . "
3677	3702	3649	3649	Dumbledore	108	" It 's lucky it 's dark . I have n't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs . "
3714	3747	3703	3704	Professor McGonagall	109	" The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around . You know what everyone 's saying ? About why he 's disappeared ? About what finally stopped him ? "
3808	3810	3790	3790	she	486	" everyone "
3843	3849	3850	3850	she	486	" What they 're saying , "
3854	3892	3850	3850	she	486	" is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric 's Hollow . He went to find the Potters . The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they 're -- dead . "
3902	3925	3898	3899	Professor McGonagall	109	" Lily and James ... I ca n't believe it ... I did n't want to believe it ... Oh , Albus ... "
3936	3943	3944	3944	he	108	" I know ... I know ... "
3958	4026	3948	3949	Professor McGonagall	109	" That 's not all . They 're saying he tried to kill the Potter 's son , Harry . But -- he could n't . He could n't kill that little boy . No one knows why , or how , but they 're saying that when he could n't kill Harry Potter , Voldemort 's power somehow broke -- and that 's why he 's gone .
4031	4039	4041	4042	Professor McGonagall	109	" It 's -- it 's true ? "
4044	4090	4041	4042	Professor McGonagall	109	" After all he 's done ... all the people he 's killed ... he could n't kill a little boy ? It 's just astounding ... of all the things to stop him ... but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive ? "
4091	4097	4099	4099	Dumbledore	108	" We can only guess , "
4101	4107	4099	4099	Dumbledore	108	" We may never know . "
4188	4210	4178	4178	he	108	" Hagrid 's late . I suppose it was he who told you I 'd be here , by the way ? "
4211	4214	4216	4217	Professor McGonagall	109	" Yes , "
4219	4240	4216	4217	Professor McGonagall	109	" And I do n't suppose you 're going to tell me why you 're here , of all places ? "
4241	4264	4178	4178	he	108	" I 've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle . They 're the only family he has left now . "
4265	4281	4283	4284	Professor McGonagall	109	" You do n't mean -- you ca n't mean the people who live here ? "
4296	4354	4283	4284	Professor McGonagall	109	" Dumbledore -- you ca n't . I 've been watching them all day . You could n't find two people who are less like us . And they 've got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street , screaming for sweets . Harry Potter come and live here ! "
4355	4364	4366	4366	Dumbledore	108	" It 's the best place for him , "
4369	4394	4366	4366	Dumbledore	108	" His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he 's older . I 've written them a letter . "
4395	4399	4401	4402	Professor McGonagall	109	" A letter ? "
4412	4478	4401	4402	Professor McGonagall	109	" Really , Dumbledore , you think you can explain all this in a letter ? These people will never understand him ! He 'll be famous -- a legend -- I would n't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child in our world will know his name ! "
4479	4482	4484	4484	Dumbledore	108	" Exactly , "
4499	4553	4484	4484	Dumbledore	108	" It would be enough to turn any boy 's head . Famous before he can walk and talk ! Famous for something he wo n't even remember ! CarA you see how much better off he 'll be , growing up away from all that until he 's ready to take it ? "
4570	4592	4593	4593	She	490	" Yes -- yes , you 're right , of course . But how is the boy getting here , Dumbledore ? "
4610	4616	4600	4600	she	490	" Hagrid 's bringing him . "
4617	4634	4600	4600	she	490	" You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as this ? "
4643	4646	4635	4635	I	0	" said Dumbledore .
4647	4661	4663	4664	Professor McGonagall	109	" I 'm not saying his heart is n't in the right place , "
4667	4687	4663	4664	Professor McGonagall	109	" but you ca n't pretend he 's not careless . He does tend to -- what was that ? "
4848	4851	4853	4853	Dumbledore	108	" Hagrid , "
4858	4870	4853	4853	Dumbledore	108	" At last . And where did you get that motorcycle ? "
4871	4880	4882	4883	the giant	499	" Borrowed it , Professor Dumbledore , sit , "
4894	4910	4882	4883	the giant	499	" Young Sirius Black lent it to me . I 've got him , sir . "
4911	4918	4891	4891	he	499	" No problems , were there ? "
4919	4955	4882	4883	the giant	499	" No , sir -- house was almost destroyed , but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin ' around . He fell asleep as we was flyin ' over Bristol . "
5006	5012	5014	5015	Professor McGonagall	109	" Is that where - ? "
5017	5020	5022	5022	Dumbledore	108	" Yes , "
5024	5032	5022	5022	Dumbledore	108	" He 'll have that scar forever . "
5033	5044	5096	5096	Dumbledore	108	" Could n't you do something about it , Dumbledore ? "
5045	5095	5022	5022	Dumbledore	108	" Even if I could , I would n't . Scars can come in handy . I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground . Well -- give him here , Hagrid -- we 'd better get this over with . "
5110	5125	5127	5127	Hagrid	282	" Could I -- could I say good - bye to him , sir ? "
5166	5169	5171	5172	Professor McGonagall	109	" Shhh ! "
5174	5181	5171	5172	Professor McGonagall	109	" you 'll wake the Muggles ! "
5182	5189	5191	5191	Hagrid	282	" S - s - sorry , "
5207	5235	5191	5191	Hagrid	282	" But I c - c - can't stand it -- Lily an ' James dead -- an ' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles - "
5236	5262	5263	5264	Professor McGonagall	109	" Yes , yes , it 's all very sad , but get a grip on yourself , Hagrid , or we 'll be found , "
5363	5366	5368	5368	Dumbledore	108	" Well , "
5371	5393	5368	5368	Dumbledore	108	" that 's that . We 've no business staying here . We may as well go and join the celebrations . "
5394	5397	5399	5399	Hagrid	282	" Yeah , "
5406	5427	5399	5399	Hagrid	282	" I 'll be takin ' Sirius his bike back . G'night , Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore , sir . "
5464	5477	5479	5479	Dumbledore	118	" I shall see you soon , I expect , Professor McGonagall , "
5574	5580	5581	5581	he	118	" Good luck , Harry , "
5747	5757	5739	5739	their	516	" To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived ! "
5987	5995	5975	5975	her	106	" Up ! Get up ! Now ! "
6010	6013	6014	6014	she	2377	" Up ! "
6091	6097	6098	6098	she	2377	" Are you up yet ? "
6101	6104	6106	6106	Harry	95	" Nearly , "
6108	6143	6083	6084	His aunt	2377	" Well , get a move on , I want you to look after the bacon . And do n't you dare let it burn , I want everything perfect on Duddy 's birthday . "
6147	6153	6154	6155	his aunt	2377	" What did you say ? "
6161	6166	6154	6155	his aunt	2377	" Nothing , nothing ... "
6499	6509	6510	6510	she	106	" In the car crash when your parents died , "
6514	6521	6510	6510	she	106	" And do n't ask questions . "
6553	6558	6559	6559	he	121	" Comb your hair ! "
6742	6747	6748	6748	he	98	" Thirty - six , "
6759	6768	6748	6748	he	98	" That 's two less than last year . "
6769	6795	6738	6738	His	98	" Darling , you have n't counted Auntie Marge 's present , see , it 's here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy . "
6796	6805	6807	6807	Dudley	98	" All right , thirty - seven then , "
6857	6886	6853	6853	she	106	" And we 'll buy you another two presents while we 're out today . How 's that , popkin ? Two more presents . Is that all right ''
6904	6913	6900	6900	he	98	" So I 'll have thirty ... thirty ... "
6914	6921	6923	6924	Aunt Petunia	106	" Thirty - nine , sweetums , "
6926	6929	6930	6930	Dudley	98	" Oh . "
6940	6945	6930	6930	Dudley	98	" All right then . "
6950	6970	6971	6971	He	121	" Little tyke wants his money 's worth , just like his father . ' Atta boy , Dudley ! "
7043	7049	7050	7050	she	106	" Bad news , Vernon , "
7053	7067	7068	7068	She	106	" Mrs. Figg 's broken her leg . She ca n't take him . "
7172	7176	7178	7179	Aunt Petunia	106	" Now what ? "
7239	7245	7246	7247	Uncle Vernon	121	" We could phone Marge , "
7250	7263	7264	7265	The Dursleys	97	" Do n't be silly , Vernon , she hates the boy . "
7300	7314	7264	7265	The Dursleys	97	" What about what's - her - name , your friend -- Yvonne ? "
7315	7321	7323	7324	Aunt Petunia	106	" On vacation in Majorca , "
7326	7334	7335	7335	Harry	95	" You could just leave me here , "
7378	7389	7390	7390	she	106	" And come back and find the house in ruins ? "
7393	7402	7404	7404	Harry	95	" I wo n't blow up the house , "
7412	7423	7425	7426	Aunt Petunia	106	" I suppose we could take him to the zoo , "
7429	7438	7425	7426	Aunt Petunia	106	" ... and leave him in the car .... "
7439	7453	7425	7426	Aunt Petunia	106	" That car 's new , he 's not sitting in it alone .... "

7755	7784	7739	7739	he	121	" I 'm warning you now , boy -- any funny business , anything at all -- and you 'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas . "
7785	7794	7796	7796	Harry	95	" I 'm not going to do anything , "
7798	7800	7796	7796	Harry	95	" honestly ..
7888	7895	7886	7886	she	106	" to hide that horrible scar . "

8313	8320	8305	8305	I	0	" said Harry , remembering suddenly . "
8325	8325	8305	8305	I	0	"

8785	8790	8791	8791	he	98	" Make it move , "
8811	8816	8817	8817	Dudley	98	" Do it again , "

9106	9112	9162	9162	Harry	95	" Was it nice there ? "

10270	10275	10277	10277	Harry	95	" No , thanks , "

10595	10600	10601	10601	he	95	" What 's this ? "
10621	10627	10628	10628	she	106	" Your new school uniform , "

10668	10695	10665	10666	Aunt Petunia	106	" I 'm dyeing some of Dudley 's old things gray for you . It 'll look just like everyone else 's when I 've finished . "
10807	10814	10816	10817	Uncle Vernon	121	" Get the mail , Dudley , "
10823	10829	10791	10791	They	667	" Make Harry get it . "

11072	11078	11080	11081	Uncle Vernon	121	" Hurry up , boy ! "
11086	11097	11098	11098	He	121	" What are you doing , checking for letter bombs ? "
11157	11162	11163	11163	he	121	" Marge 's ill , "

11437	11442	11428	11428	he	98	" said Harry furiously , "
11448	11448	11428	11428	he	98	"
11449	11457	11459	11460	Uncle Vernon	121	" Get out , both of you , "
11480	11483	11475	11475	I	0	" he shouted .

11588	11613	11579	11580	Aunt Petunia	106	" look at the address -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps ? You do n't think they 're watching the house ? "
11614	11624	11626	11627	Uncle Vernon	121	" Watching -- spying -- might be following us , "
11630	11651	11579	11580	Aunt Petunia	106	" But what should we do , Vernon ? Should we write back ? Tell them we do n't want -- "
11668	11671	11672	11672	he	95	" No , "
11676	11703	11672	11672	he	95	" No , we 'll ignore it . If they do n't get an answer ... Yes , that 's best ... we wo n't do anything ....
11704	11707	11652	11652	Harry	95	" But -- "
11708	11737	11672	11672	he	95	" I 'm not having one in the house , Petunia ! Did n't we swear when we took him in we 'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense ? "
11764	11770	11772	11772	Harry	95	" Where 's my letter ? "
11784	11791	11772	11772	Harry	95	" Who 's writing to me ? "
11792	11804	11806	11807	Uncle Vernon	121	" No one . it was addressed to you by mistake , "
11810	11816	11806	11807	Uncle Vernon	121	" I have burned it . "
11817	11824	11826	11826	Harry	95	" It was not a mistake , "
11829	11837	11826	11826	Harry	95	" it had my cupboard on it . "
11838	11841	11843	11844	Uncle Vernon	121	" SILENCE ! "
11876	11919	11856	11856	He	121	" Er -- yes , Harry -- about this cupboard . Your aunt and I have been thinking ... you 're really getting a bit big for it ... we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley 's second bedroom .
11920	11923	11925	11925	Harry	95	" Why ? "
11927	11933	11935	11936	his uncle	685	" Do n't ask questions ! "
11938	11946	11935	11936	his uncle	685	" Take this stuff upstairs , now . "

12493	12501	12488	12488	he	121	" Dudley -- go -- just go . "
12775	12812	12772	12772	I	0	" he began , but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes . Uncle Vernon did nt go to work that day . He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot .
12813	12816	12817	12817	he	121	" See , "
12828	12841	12817	12817	he	121	" if they ca n't deliver them they 'll just give up . "
12842	12853	12772	12772	I	0	" I 'm not sure that 'll work , Vernon . "
12854	12876	12878	12879	Uncle Vernon	121	" Oh , these people 's minds work in strange ways , Petunia , they 're not like you and me , "
12987	12992	12985	12985	He	121	" Tiptoe Through the Tulips "
13085	13097	13098	13098	Dudley	98	" Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly ? "
13125	13131	13132	13132	he	121	" No post on Sundays , "
13144	13150	13132	13132	he	121	" no damn letters today -- "

13434	13442	13443	13443	he	121	" Shake'em off ... shake 'em off , "
13601	13629	13630	13630	She	744	" ' Scuse me , but is one of you Mr. H. Potter ? Only I got about an ' undred of these at the front desk . "
13674	13680	13682	13683	Uncle Vernon	121	" I 'll take them , "
13708	13798	13682	13683	Uncle Vernon	121	" Aunt Petunia suggested timidly , hours later , but Uncle Vernon did n't seem to hear her . Exactly what he was looking for , none of them knew . He drove them into the middle of a forest , got out , looked around , shook his head , got back in the car , and off they went again . The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field , halfway across a suspension bridge , and at the top of a multilevel parking garage .
13799	13809	13810	13810	Dudley	98	" Daddy 's gone mad , has n't he ? "
13856	13861	13862	13862	he	142	" It 's Monday , "
13867	13884	13862	13862	he	142	" The Great Humberto 's on tonight . I want to stay somewhere with a television . "
13999	14005	14006	14006	he	121	" Found the perfect place ! "

14069	14075	14077	14078	Uncle Vernon	121	" Storm forecast for tonight ! "
14086	14099	14082	14082	his	121	" And this gentleman 's kindly agreed to lend us his boat ! "
14132	14141	14143	14144	Uncle Vernon	121	" I 've already got us some rations , "
14146	14151	14143	14144	Uncle Vernon	121	" so all aboard ! "
14274	14286	14287	14287	he	121	" Could do with some of those letters now , eh ? "
14720	14726	14727	14727	he	142	" Where 's the cannon ? "
14773	14778	14779	14779	he	121	" Who 's there ? "

14930	14952	14922	14922	He	499	" Could n't make us a cup o ' tea , could yeh ? It 's not been an easy journey ... "
14966	14974	14976	14977	the stranger	782	" Budge up , yeh great lump , "

15053	15070	15050	15051	the giant	499	" Yeh look a lot like yet dad , but yeh've got yet mom 's eyes . "
15089	15093	15079	15079	I	0	" he said . "
15100	15100	15118	15118	he	499	"
15101	15113	15115	15116	the giant	499	" Ah , shut up , Dursley , yeh great prune , "
15177	15182	15184	15185	the giant	499	" Anyway -- Harry , "

15343	15352	15353	15353	he	499	" What about that tea then , eh ? "
15361	15377	15353	15353	he	499	" I 'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it , mind . "
15575	15586	15570	15571	Uncle Vernon	121	" Do n't touch anything he gives you , Dudley . "

15658	15674	15655	15655	he	95	" I 'm sorry , but I still do n't really know who you are . "
15693	15698	15699	15699	he	499	" Call me Hagrid , "

15839	15847	15836	15836	Hagrid	282	" Now wait jus ' one second ! "

15932	15938	15939	15939	he	282	" I know some things , "

16220	16226	16228	16228	Harry	95	" Kept what from me ? "
16231	16238	16240	16241	Uncle Vernon	121	" STOP ! I FORBID YOU ! "
16253	16265	16267	16267	Hagrid	282	" Ah , go boil yet heads , both of yeh , "
16269	16276	16267	16267	Hagrid	282	" Harry -- yet a wizard . "

16304	16312	16314	16314	Hagrid	282	" A wizard , o ' course , "
16330	16379	16314	16314	Hagrid	282	" an ' a thumpin ' good'un , I 'd say , once yeh've been trained up a bit . With a mum an ' dad like yours , what else would yeh be ? An ' I reckon it 's abou ' time yeh read yer letter . "
16544	16555	16541	16541	he	95	" What does it mean , they await my owl ? "
16556	16565	16567	16567	Hagrid	282	" Gallopin ' Gorgons , that reminds me , "
16726	16731	16733	16733	Hagrid	282	" Where was I ? "
16757	16763	16764	16764	he	121	" He 's not going , "
16770	16784	16785	16785	he	121	" I 'd like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him , "
16788	16792	16794	16794	Harry	95	" A what ? "
16798	16802	16804	16804	Hagrid	282	" A Muggle , "
16806	16841	16804	16804	Hagrid	282	" it 's what we call nonmagic folk like thern . An ' it 's your bad luck you grew up in a family o ' the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on . "
16842	16859	16861	16862	Uncle Vernon	121	" We swore when we took him in we 'd put a stop to that rubbish , "
16864	16877	16861	16862	Uncle Vernon	121	" swore we 'd stamp it out of him ! Wizard indeed ! "
16878	16882	16884	16884	Harry	95	" You knew ? "
16886	16896	16884	16884	Harry	95	" You knew I 'm a -- a wizard ? "
16897	16900	16902	16903	Aunt Petunia	106	" Knew ! "
16906	17009	16902	16903	Aunt Petunia	106	" Knew ! Of course we knew ! How could you not be , my dratted sister being what she was ? Oh , she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that - that school - and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn , turning teacups into rats . I was the only one who saw her for what she was -- a freak ! But for my mother and father , oh no , it was Lily this and Lily that , they were proud of having a witch in the family ! "
17036	17098	17025	17025	she	816	" Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you , and of course I knew you 'd be just the same , just as strange , just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then , if you please , she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you ! "
17115	17129	17112	17112	he	95	" Blown up ? You told me they died in a car crash ! "
17130	17134	17136	17136	Hagrid	282	" CAR CRASH ! "
17151	17190	17143	17144	the Dursleys	97	" How could a car crash kill Lily an ' James Potter ? It 's an outrage ! A scandal ! Harry Potter not knowin ' his own story when every kid in our world knows his name ! "
17191	17198	17199	17199	Harry	95	" But why ? What happened ? "
17216	17222	17223	17223	he	282	" I never expected this , "
17233	17296	17223	17223	he	282	" I had no idea , when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin ' hold of yeh , how much yeh did n't know . Ah , Harry , I don ' know if I 'm the right person ter tell yeh -- but someone 3 s got ta -- yeh ca n't go off ter Hogwarts not knowin ' . "
17306	17342	17297	17297	He	282	" Well , it 's best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh -- mind , I ca n't tell yeh everythin ' , it 's a great myst'ry , parts of it .... "
17360	17391	17343	17343	He	282	" It begins , I suppose , with -- with a person called -- but it 's incredible yeh do n't know his name , everyone in our world knows -- "
17392	17395	17343	17343	He	282	" Who ? "
17396	17417	17343	17343	He	282	" Well -- I don ' like sayin ' the name if I can help it . No one does . "
17418	17422	17343	17343	He	282	" Why not ? "
17423	17469	17343	17343	He	282	" Gulpin ' gargoyles , Harry , people are still scared . Blimey , this is difficult . See , there was this wizard who went ... bad . As bad as you could go . Worse . Worse than worse . His name was ... "
17479	17486	17487	17487	Harry	95	" Could you write it down ? "
17490	17501	17502	17502	Hagrid	282	" Nah -can't spell it . All right -- Voldemort . "
17505	17654	17502	17502	Hagrid	282	" Don ' make me say it again . Anyway , this -- this wizard , about twenty years ago now , started lookin ' fer followers . Got 'em , too -- some were afraid , some just wanted a bit o ' his power , 'cause he was gettin ' himself power , all right . Dark days , Harry . Did n't know who ter trust , did n't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches ... terrible things happened . He was takin ' over . ' Course , some stood up to him -- an ' he killed 'em . Horribly . One o ' the only safe places left was Hogwarts . Reckon Dumbledore 's the only one You - Know - Who was afraid of . Did n't dare try takin ' the school , not jus ' then , anyway .
17655	17725	17343	17343	He	282	" Now , yer mum an ' dad were as good a witch an ' wizard as I ever knew . Head boy an ' girl at Hogwarts in their day ! Suppose the myst'ry is why You - Know - Who never tried to get 'em on his side before ... probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin ' ter do with the Dark Side .
17726	17785	17502	17502	Hagrid	282	" Maybe he thought he could persuade 'em ... maybe he just wanted 'em outta the way . All anyone knows is , he turned up in the village where you was all living , on Halloween ten years ago . You was just a year old . He came ter yer house an ' -- an ' -- "
17807	17810	17811	17811	he	282	" Sorry , "
17814	17839	17811	17811	he	282	" But it 's that sad -- knew yer mum an ' dad , an ' nicer people yeh could n't find -- anyway ... "
17840	18021	17786	17786	Hagrid	282	" You - Know - Who killed 'em . An ' then -- an ' this is the real myst'ry of the thing -- he tried to kill you , too . Wanted ter make a clean job of it , I suppose , or maybe he just liked killin ' by then . But he could n't do it . Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead ? That was no ordinary cut . That 's what yeh get when a Powerful , evil curse touches yeh -- took care of yer mum an ' dad an ' yer house , even -- but it did n't work on you , an ' that 's why yer famous , Harry . No one ever lived after he decided ter kill 'em , no one except you , an ' he 'd killed some o ' the best witches an ' wizards of the age -- the McKinnons , the Bones , the Prewetts -- an ' you was only a baby , an ' you lived . "
18090	18110	18084	18084	Hagrid	282	" Took yeh from the ruined house myself , on Dumbledore 's orders . Brought yeh ter this lot ... "
18111	18117	18119	18120	Uncle Vernon	121	" Load of old tosh , "
18157	18166	18167	18167	he	121	" Now , you listen here , boy , "
18170	18250	18167	18167	he	121	" I accept there 's something strange about you , probably nothing a good beating would n't have cured -- and as for all this about your parents , well , they were weirdos , no denying it , and the world 's better off without them in my opinion -- asked for all they got , getting mixed up with these wizarding types -- just what I expected , always knew they 'd come to a sticky end -- "
18284	18299	18281	18281	he	282	" I 'm warning you , Dursley -I'm warning you -- one more word ... "
18333	18338	18340	18340	Hagrid	282	" That 's better , "
18376	18394	18585	18585	Hagrid	282	" But what happened to Vol-- , sorry -- I mean , You - Know - Who ? "
18395	18441	18585	18585	Hagrid	282	" Good question , Harry . Disappeared . Vanished . Same night he tried ter kill you . Makes yeh even more famous . That 's the biggest myst'ry , see ... he was gettin ' more an ' more powerful -- why 'd he go ?
18442	18519	18585	18585	Hagrid	282	" Some say he died . Codswallop , in my opinion . Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die . Some say he 's still out there , bidin ' his time , like , but I don ' believe it . People who was on his side came back ter ours . Some of 'em came outta kinda trances . Don~ reckon they could 've done if he was comin ' back .
18520	18584	18585	18585	Hagrid	282	" Most of us reckon he 's still out there somewhere but lost his powers . Too weak to carry on . 'Cause somethin' about you finished him , Harry . There was somethin' goin' on that night he had n't counted on -- I dunno what it was , no one does -- but somethin' about you stumped him , all right . "
18703	18706	18707	18707	he	2492	" Hagrid , "
18711	18731	18707	18707	he	2492	" I think you must have made a mistake . I do n't think I can be a wizard . "
18739	18757	18736	18736	Hagrid	282	" Not a wizard , eh ? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry ? "
18886	18889	18891	18891	Hagrid	282	" See ? "
18893	18912	18891	18891	Hagrid	282	" Harry Potter , not a wizard -- you wait , you 'll be right famous at Hogwarts . "
18926	18937	18938	18938	he	121	" Have n't I told you he 's not going ? "
18941	18975	18938	18938	he	121	" He 's going to Stonewall High and he 'll be grateful for it . I 've read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish -- spell books and wands and -- "
18976	18993	18995	18995	Hagrid	282	" If he wants ter go , a great Muggle like you wo n't stop him , "
18997	19078	18995	18995	Hagrid	282	" Stop Lily an ' James Potter ' s son goin' ter Hogwarts ! Yer mad . His name 's been down ever since he was born . He 's off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world . Seven years there and he wo n't know himself . He 'll be with youngsters of his own sort , fer a change , an ' he 'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled-- "
19079	19095	19097	19098	Uncle Vernon	121	" I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS ! "
19119	19122	19123	19123	he	282	" NEVER , "
19126	19136	19123	19123	he	282	" - INSULT- ALBUS- DUMBLEDORE- IN- FRONT- OF- ME ! "
19256	19262	19263	19263	he	282	" Shouldn'ta lost me temper , "
19267	19302	19263	19263	he	282	" but it did n't work anyway . Meant ter turn him into a pig , but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there was n't much left ter do . "
19315	19329	19330	19330	he	282	" Be grateful if yeh did n't mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts , "
19333	19383	19330	19330	he	282	" I 'm -- er -- not supposed ter do magic , strictly speakin ' . I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an ' get yer letters to yeh an ' stuff -- one o ' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job
19384	19394	19396	19396	Harry	95	" Why are n't you supposed to do magic ? "
19398	19451	19330	19330	he	282	" Oh , well -- I was at Hogwarts meself but I -- er -- got expelled , ter tell yeh the truth . In me third year . They snapped me wand in half an ' everything . But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper . Great man , Dumbledore . "
19452	19458	19496	19496	He	282	" Why were you expelled ? "
19459	19474	19476	19476	Hagrid	282	" It 's gettin ' late and we 've got lots ter do tomorrow , "
19479	19495	19476	19476	Hagrid	282	" Got ta get up ter town , get all yer books an ' that . "
19509	19516	19517	19517	he	282	" You can kip under that , "
19520	19547	19517	19517	he	282	" Don ' mind if it wriggles a bit , I think I still got a couple o ' dormice in one o ' the pockets . "
19574	19585	19586	19586	I	0	" It was a dream , he told himself firmly . "
19619	19619	19610	19610	I	0	"
19668	19672	19673	19673	Harry	95	" All right , "
19676	19682	19673	19673	Harry	95	" I 'm getting up . "
19800	19806	19766	19767	The owl	838	" Do n't do that . "
19833	19836	19838	19838	Harry	95	" Hagrid ! "
19841	19845	19838	19838	Harry	95	" There 's an owl
19846	19850	19851	19851	Hagrid	282	" Pay him , "
19857	19860	19851	19851	Hagrid	282	" What ? "
19861	19877	19878	19878	Hagrid	282	" He wants payin ' fer deliverin ' the paper . Look in the pockets . "
19919	19925	19927	19927	Hagrid	282	" Give him five Knuts , "
19930	19933	19972	19972	he	95	" Knuts ? "
19934	19940	19972	19972	he	95	" The little bronze ones . "
19990	20017	19980	19980	Hagrid	282	" Best be Off , Harry , lots ter do today , got ta get up ter London an ' buy all yer stuff fer school . "
20052	20057	20018	20018	Harry	95	" Um -- Hagrid ? "
20058	20061	20063	20063	Hagrid	282	" Mm ? "
20073	20101	20018	20018	Harry	95	" I have n't got any money -- and you heard Uncle Vernon last night ... he wo n't pay for me to go and learn magic . "
20102	20109	20111	20111	Hagrid	282	" Do n't worry about that , "
20120	20131	20111	20111	Hagrid	282	" D'yeh think yer parents did n't leave yeh anything ? "
20132	20140	20018	20018	Harry	95	" But if their house was destroyed -- "
20141	20195	20111	20111	Hagrid	282	" They didn ' keep their gold in the house , boy ! Nah , first stop fer us is Gringotts . Wizards ' bank . Have a sausage , they 're not bad cold -- an ' I wouldn ' say no teh a bit o ' yer birthday cake , neither . "
20196	20201	20018	20018	Harry	95	" Wizards have banks ? "
20202	20213	20111	20111	Hagrid	282	" Just the one . Gringotts . Run by goblins . "
20224	20227	20018	20018	Harry	95	" Goblins ? "
20228	20296	20297	20297	Hagrid	282	" Yeah -- so yeh'd be mad ter try an ' rob it , I 'll tell yeh that . Never mess with goblins , Harry . Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe -- ' cept maybe Hogwarts . As a matter o ' fact , I got ta visit Gringotts anyway . Fer Dumbledore . Hogwarts business . "
20303	20331	20299	20299	himself	282	" He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him . Fetchin ' you gettin ' things from Gringotts -- knows he can trust me , see .
20332	20342	20018	20018	Harry	95	" Got everythin ' ? Come on , then . "
20387	20394	20395	20395	Harry	95	" How did you get here ? "
20404	20407	20409	20409	Hagrid	282	" Flew , "

20415	20437	20468	20468	Hagrid	282	" Yeah -- but we 'll go back in this . Not s'pposed ter use magic now I 've got yeh . "
20457	20466	20468	20468	Hagrid	282	" Seems a shame ter row , though , "
20478	20502	20468	20468	Hagrid	282	" If I was ter -- er -- speed things up a bit , would yeh mind not mentionin ' it at Hogwarts ? "
20503	20508	20510	20510	Harry	95	" Of course not , "
20543	20555	20556	20556	Harry	95	" Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts ? "
20559	20564	20566	20566	Hagrid	282	" Spells -- enchantments , "
20575	20633	20566	20566	Hagrid	282	" They say there 's dragons guardin ' the highsecurity vaults . And then yeh got ta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London , see . Deep under the Underground . Yeh'd die of hunger tryin ' ter get out , even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat . "
20685	20697	20698	20698	Hagrid	282	" Ministry o ' Magic messin ' things up as usual , "

20723	20727	20729	20729	Hagrid	282	" ' Course , "
20731	20778	20729	20729	Hagrid	282	" They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister , 0 ' course , but he 'd never leave Hogwarts , so old Cornelius Fudge got the job . Bungler if ever there was one . So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning , askin ' fer advice . "
20779	20789	20714	20714	Harry	95	" But what does a Ministry of Magic do ? "
20790	20818	20729	20729	Hagrid	282	" Well , their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there 's still witches an ' wizards up an ' down the country . "
20819	20822	20714	20714	Harry	95	" Why ? "
20823	20848	20729	20729	Hagrid	282	" Why ? Blimey , Harry , everyone'd be wantin ' magic solutions to their problems . Nah , we 're best left alone . "
20926	20940	20912	20912	he	282	" See that , Harry ? Things these Muggles dream up , eh ? "
20941	20944	20946	20946	Harry	95	" Hagrid , "
20958	20968	20946	20946	Harry	95	" did you say there are dragons at Gringotts ? "
20969	20976	20978	20978	Hagrid	282	" Well , so they say , "
20980	20989	20978	20978	Hagrid	282	" Crikey , I 'd like a dragon . "
20990	20996	20946	20946	Harry	95	" You 'd like one ? "
20997	21011	20978	20978	Hagrid	282	" Wanted one ever since I was a kid -- here we go . "

23984	24027	24028	24028	He	282	" Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty - nine Knuts to a Sickle , it 's easy enough . Right , that should be enough fer a couple o ' terms , we 'll keep the rest safe for yeh . "
24033	24050	24028	24028	He	282	" Vault seven hundred and thirteen now , please , and can we go more slowly ? "
24051	24056	24058	24058	Griphook	174	" One speed only , "
24132	24136	24138	24138	Griphook	174	" Stand back , "
24158	24180	24182	24182	Griphook	174	" If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that , they 'd be sucked through the door and trapped in there , "
24184	24197	24198	24198	Harry	95	" How often do you check to see if anyone 's inside ? "
24201	24208	24210	24210	Griphook	174	" About once every ten years , "
24302	24333	24335	24335	Hagrid	282	" Come on , back in this infernal cart , and do n't talk to me on the way back , it 's best if I keep me mouth shut , "
24409	24417	24419	24419	Hagrid	282	" Might as well get yer uniform , "
24431	24461	24462	24462	He	95	" Listen , Harry , would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick - me - up in the Leaky Cauldron ? I hate them Gringotts carts . "
24495	24500	24501	24501	she	969	" Hogwarts , clear ? "
24510	24528	24501	24501	she	969	" Got the lot here -- another young man being fitted up just now , in fact . "
24589	24592	24594	24595	the boy	436	" Hello , "
24597	24602	24594	24595	the boy	436	" Hogwarts , too ? "
24603	24606	24608	24608	Harry	95	" Yes , "
24610	24629	24631	24632	the boy	436	" My father 's next door buying my books and mother 's up the street looking at wands , "
24642	24688	24634	24634	He	436	" Then I 'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms . I do n't see why first years ca n't have their own . I think I 'll bully father into getting me one and I 'll smuggle it in somehow . "
24696	24704	24705	24706	the boy	436	" Have you got your own broom ? "
24710	24713	24715	24715	Harry	95	" No , "
24717	24723	24705	24706	the boy	436	" Play Quidditch at all ? "
24724	24727	24728	24728	Harry	95	" No , "
24740	24778	24705	24706	the boy	436	" I do -- Father says it 's a crime if I 'm not picked to play for my house , and I must say , I agree . Know what house you 'll be in yet ? "
24779	24782	24784	24784	Harry	95	" No , "
24793	24838	24705	24706	the boy	436	" Well , no one really knows until they get there , do they , but I know I 'll be in Slytherin , all our family have been -- imagine being in Hufflepuff , I think I 'd leave , would n't you ? "
24839	24842	24844	24844	Harry	95	" Mmm , "
24856	24865	24867	24868	the boy	436	" I say , look at that man ! "
24900	24905	24907	24907	Harry	95	" That 's Hagrid , "
24918	24924	24907	24907	Harry	95	" He works at Hogwarts . "
24925	24928	24930	24931	the boy	436	" Oh , "
24933	24951	24930	24931	the boy	436	" I 've heard of him . He 's a sort of servant , is n't he ? "
24952	24958	24960	24960	Harry	95	" He 's the gamekeeper , "
24973	25018	24930	24931	the boy	436	" Yes , exactly . I heard he 's a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk , tries to do magic , and ends up setting fire to his bed . "
25019	25026	25028	25028	Harry	95	" I think he 's brilliant , "
25031	25035	25037	25038	the boy	436	" Do you ? "
25045	25057	25037	25038	the boy	436	" Why is he with you ? Where are your parents ? "
25058	25063	25065	25065	Harry	95	" They 're dead , "
25082	25087	25089	25090	the other	982	" Oh , sorry , "
25099	25110	25089	25090	the other	982	" But they were our kind , were n't they ? "
25111	25126	25037	25038	the boy	436	" They were a witch and wizard , if that 's what you mean . "
25127	25198	25089	25090	the other	982	" I really do n't think they should let the other sort in , do you ? They 're just not the same , they 've never been brought up to know our ways . Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter , imagine . I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families . What 's your surname , anyway ? "
25209	25218	25205	25206	Madam Malkin	175	" That 's you done , my dear , "
25240	25253	25255	25257	the drawling boy	984	" Well , I 'll see you at Hogwarts , I suppose , "
25282	25287	25289	25289	Hagrid	282	" What 's up ? "
25291	25294	25295	25295	Harry	95	" Nothing , "
25335	25342	25332	25332	he	95	" Hagrid , what 's Quidditch ? "
25343	25363	25332	25332	he	95	" Blimey , Harry , I keep forgettin ' how little yeh know -- not knowin ' about Quidditch ! "
25364	25372	25374	25374	Harry	95	" Do n't make me feel worse , "
25388	25403	25332	25332	he	95	" --and he said people from Muggle families should n't even be allowed in . "
25404	25497	25332	25332	he	95	" Yer not from a Muggle family . If he 'd known who yeh were -- he 's grown up knowin ' yer name if his parents are wizardin ' folk . You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh . Anyway , what does he know about it , some o ' the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in 'em in a long line 0 ' Muggles -- look at yer mum ! Look what she had fer a sister ! "
25498	25504	25332	25332	he	95	" So what is Quidditch ? "
25505	25549	25332	25332	he	95	" It 's our sport . Wizard sport . It 's like -- like soccer in the Muggle world -- everyone follows Quidditch -- played up in the air on broomsticks and there 's four balls -- sorta hard ter explain the rules . "
25550	25558	25332	25332	he	95	" And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff ? "
25559	25579	25332	25332	he	95	" School houses . There 's four . Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o ' duffers , but -- "
25580	25587	25589	25589	Harry	95	" I bet I 'm in Hufflepuff "
25592	25598	25600	25600	Hagrid	282	" Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin , "
25603	25629	25600	25600	Hagrid	282	" There 's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who was n't in Slytherin . You - Know - Who was one . "
25630	25644	25332	25332	he	95	" Vol- , sorry - You - Know - Who was at Hogwarts ? "
25645	25652	25654	25654	Hagrid	282	" Years an ' years ago , "
25780	25792	25824	25824	Hagrid	282	" I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley . "
25793	25822	25824	25824	Hagrid	282	" I 'm not sayin ' that 's not a good idea , but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances , "
25826	25854	25824	25824	Hagrid	282	" An ' anyway , yeh couldn ' work any of them curses yet , yeh'll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level . "
25868	25875	25855	25855	Hagrid	282	" It says pewter on yer list "
26019	26040	26012	26012	Hagrid	282	" Just yer wand left - A yeah , an ' I still have n't got yeh a birthday present . "
26047	26054	26041	26041	Harry	95	" You do n't have to -- "
26055	26129	26041	26041	Harry	95	" I know I do n't have to . Tell yeh what , I 'll get yer animal . Not a toad , toads went outta fashion years ago , yeh'd be laughed at - an ' I don ' like cats , they make me sneeze . I 'll get yer an owl . All the kids want owls , they 're dead useful , carry yer mail an ' everythin ' . "
26192	26198	26200	26200	Hagrid	282	" Don ' mention it , "
26203	26238	26200	26200	Hagrid	282	" Don ' expect you 've had a lotta presents from them Dursleys . Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands , Ollivanders , and yeh got ta have the best wand . "
26398	26402	26434	26436	An old man	1006	" Good afternoon , "
26457	26460	26462	26462	Harry	95	" Hello , "
26465	26469	26471	26472	the man	444	" Ah yes , "
26474	26491	26471	26472	the man	444	" Yes , yes . I thought I 'd be seeing you soon . Harry Potter . "
26498	26540	26471	26472	the man	444	" You have your mother 's eyes . It seems only yesterday she was in here herself , buying her first wand . Ten and a quarter inches long , swishy , made of willow . Nice wand for charm work . "
26562	26612	26541	26542	Mr. Ollivander	185	" Your father , on the other hand , favored a mahogany wand . Eleven inches . Pliable . A little more power and excellent for transfiguration . Well , I say your father favored it -- it 's really the wand that chooses the wizard , of course . "
26639	26645	26632	26632	himself	95	" And that 's where ... "
26663	26677	26678	26678	he	185	" I 'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it , "
26682	26724	26678	26678	he	185	" Thirteen - and - a - half inches . Yew . Powerful wand , very powerful , and in the wrong hands ... well , if I 'd known what that wand was going out into the world to do .... "
26740	26765	26727	26727	his	185	" Rubeus ! Rubeus Hagrid ! How nice to see you again .... Oak , sixteen inches , rather bendy , was n't it ? "
26766	26774	26776	26776	Hagrid	282	" It was , sir , yes , "
26778	26798	26800	26801	Mr. Ollivander	185	" Good wand , that one . But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled ? "
26806	26816	26818	26818	Hagrid	282	" Er -- yes , they did , yes , "
26824	26834	26835	26835	he	185	" I 've still got the pieces , though , "
26839	26847	26849	26850	Mr. Ollivander	185	" But you do n't use them ? "
26853	26860	26862	26862	Hagrid	282	" Oh , no , sit , "
26878	26881	26883	26884	Mr. Ollivander	185	" Hmmm , "
26892	26904	26905	26905	He	185	" Well , now -- Mr. Potter . Let me see . "
26919	26926	26905	26905	He	185	" Which is your wand arm ? "
26927	26938	26940	26940	Harry	95	" Er -- well , I 'm right - handed , "
26942	26952	26953	26953	He	185	" Hold out your arm . That 's it . "
26985	27056	26982	26982	he	185	" Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance , Mr. Potter . We use unicorn hairs , phoenix tail feathers , and the heartstrings of dragons . No two Ollivander wands are the same , just as no two unicorns , dragons , or phoenixes are quite the same . And of course , you will never get such good results with another wizard 's wand . "
27091	27096	27097	27097	he	185	" That will do , "
27112	27144	27097	27097	he	185	" Right then , Mr. Potter . Try this one . Beechwood and dragon heartstring . Nine inches . Nice and flexible . just take it and give it a wave . "
27173	27187	27161	27162	Mr. Ollivander	185	" Maple and phoenix feather . Seven inches . Quite whippy . Try -- "
27210	27239	27207	27208	Mr. Ollivander	185	" No , no -here , ebony and unicorn hair , eight and a half inches , springy . Go on , go on , try it out . "
27290	27335	27251	27252	Mr. Ollivander	185	" Tricky customer , eh ? Not to worry , we 'll find the perfect match here somewhere -- I wonder , now - - yes , why not -- unusual combination -- holly and phoenix feather , eleven inches , nice and supple . "
27401	27428	27397	27398	Mr. Ollivander	185	" Oh , bravo ! Yes , indeed , oh , very good . Well , well , well ... how curious ... how very curious ... "
27448	27452	27429	27429	He	185	" Curious ... curious ..
27453	27456	27458	27458	Harry	95	" Sorry , "
27460	27466	27458	27458	Harry	95	" but what 's curious ? "
27476	27540	27472	27472	his	185	" I remember every wand I 've ever sold , Mr. Potter . Every single wand . It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand , gave another feather -- just one other . It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why , its brother gave you that scar . "
27544	27610	27472	27472	his	185	" Yes , thirteen - and - a - half inches . Yew . Curious indeed how these things happen . The wand chooses the wizard , remember .... I think we must expect great things from you , Mr. Potter .... After all , He- Who - Must - Not - Be - Named did great things -- terrible , yes , but great . "
27755	27768	27769	27769	he	282	" Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves , "
27800	27811	27813	27813	Hagrid	282	" You all right , Harry ? Yer very quiet , "
27848	27855	27856	27856	he	282	" Everyone thinks I 'm special , "
27861	27929	27856	27856	he	282	" All those people in the Leaky Cauldron , Professor Quirrell , Mr. Ollivander ... but I do n't know anything about magic at all . How can they expect great things ? I 'm famous and I ca n't even remember what I 'm famous for . I do n't know what happened when Vol- , sorry -- I mean , the night my parents died . "
27949	28019	27942	27942	he	282	" Don ' you worry , Harry . You 'll learn fast enough . Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts , you 'll be just fine . just be yerself . I know it 's hard . Yeh've been singled out , an ' that 's always hard . But yeh'll have a great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still do , ' smatter of fact . "
28042	28048	28049	28049	he	282	" Yer ticket fer Hogwarts , "
28052	28097	28049	28049	he	282	" First o ' September -- King 's Cross -- it 's all on yer ticket . Any problems with the Dursleys , send me a letter with yer owl , she 'll know where to find me .... See yeh soon , Harry . "
28438	28444	28430	28430	Dudley	98	" Er -- Uncle Vernon ? "
28454	28473	28445	28446	Uncle Vernon	121	" Er -- I need to be at King 's Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hogwarts . "
28479	28492	28474	28475	Uncle Vernon	121	" Would it be all right if you gave me a lift ? "
28501	28505	28493	28493	Grunt	188	" Thank you . "
28519	28542	28474	28475	Uncle Vernon	121	" Funny way to get to a wizards ' school , the train . Magic carpets all got punctures , have they ? "
28549	28557	28543	28543	Harry	95	" Where is this school , anyway ? "
28558	28564	28566	28566	Harry	95	" I do n't know , "
28588	28605	28606	28606	he	95	" I just take the train from platform nine and three - quarters at eleven o'clock , "
28615	28619	28609	28609	His	95	" Platform what ? "
28620	28627	28612	28612	uncle	2378	" Nine and three - quarters . "
28628	28634	28636	28637	Uncle Vernon	121	" Do n't talk rubbish , "
28639	28650	28636	28637	Uncle Vernon	121	" There is no platform nine and three - quarters . "
28651	28658	28612	28612	uncle	2378	" It 's on my ticket . "
28659	28662	28664	28665	Uncle Vernon	121	" Barking , "
28667	28711	28664	28665	Uncle Vernon	121	" howling mad , the lot of them . You 'll see . You just wait . All right , we 'll take you to King 's Cross . We 're going up to London tomorrow anyway , or I would n't bother . "
28712	28720	28721	28721	Harry	95	" Why are you going to London ? "
28730	28737	28739	28740	Uncle Vernon	121	" Taking Dudley to the hospital , "
28742	28756	28739	28740	Uncle Vernon	121	" Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings . "
28935	28973	28932	28932	his	121	" Well , there you are , boy . Platform nine -- platform ten . Your platform should be somewhere in the middle , but they do n't seem to have built it yet , do they ? "
29014	29020	29022	29023	Uncle Vernon	121	" Have a good term , "
29326	29335	29306	29309	a group of people	1054	" -- packed with Muggles , of course -- "
29407	29416	29418	29421	the boys ' mother	1060	" Now , what 's the platform number ? "
29423	29430	29432	29434	a small girl	1061	" Nine and three - quarters ! "
29447	29455	29432	29434	a small girl	1061	" Mom , ca n't I go ... "
29456	29478	29432	29434	a small girl	1061	" You 're not old enough , Ginny , now be quiet . All right , Percy , you go first . "
29546	29552	29553	29555	the plump woman	1068	" Fred , you next , "
29558	29568	29570	29571	the boy	436	" I 'm not Fred , I 'm George , "
29573	29591	29553	29555	the plump woman	1068	" Honestly , woman , you call yourself our mother ? CarA you tell I 'm George ? "
29592	29599	29553	29555	the plump woman	1068	" Sorry , George , dear . "
29600	29608	29610	29611	the boy	436	" Only joking , I am Fred , "
29683	29687	29688	29688	Harry	95	" Excuse me , "
29695	29700	29701	29701	she	1068	" Hello , dear , "
29704	29716	29701	29701	she	1068	" First time at Hogwarts ? Ron 's new , too . "
29750	29753	29755	29755	Harry	95	" Yes , "
29757	29773	29755	29755	Harry	95	" The thing is -- the thing is , I do n't know how to -- "
29774	29782	29783	29783	she	1068	" How to get onto the platform ? "
29791	29796	29797	29797	she	1068	" Not to worry , "
29800	29859	29797	29797	she	1068	" All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten . Do n't stop and do n't be scared you 'll crash into it , that 's very important . Best do it at a bit of a run if you 're nervous . Go on , go now before Ron . "
29860	29865	29867	29867	Harry	95	" Er -- okay , "
30150	30160	30141	30157	a round - faced boy who was saying , " Gran , I 've lost my toad	2733	" Gran , I 've lost my toad again . "
30161	30166	30169	30171	the old woman	1089	" Oh , Neville , "
30185	30196	30181	30183	a small crowd	1091	" Give us a look , Lee , go on . "

30639	30645	30636	30637	their mother	1113	" He 's coming now . "
30682	30690	30691	30691	he	1114	" Ca n't stay long , Mother , "
30694	30709	30691	30691	he	1114	" I 'm up front , the prefects have got two compartments to themselves -- "
30710	30720	30722	30725	one of the twins	1102	" Oh , are you a prefect , Percy ? "
30734	30746	30722	30725	one of the twins	1102	" You should have said something , we had no idea . "
30747	30761	30763	30765	the other twin	1104	" Hang on , I think I remember him saying something about it , "
30767	30770	30763	30765	the other twin	1104	" Once -- "
30771	30775	30722	30725	one of the twins	1102	" Or twice -- "
30776	30780	30763	30765	the other twin	1104	" A minute -- "
30781	30785	30722	30725	one of the twins	1102	" All summer -- "
30786	30792	30794	30796	Percy the Prefect	200	" Oh , shut up , "
30798	30808	30810	30813	one of the twins	1102	" How come Percy gets new robes , anyway ? "
30815	30822	30824	30825	their mother	1113	" Because he 's a prefect , "
30828	30850	30824	30825	their mother	1113	" All right , dear , well , have a good term -- send me an owl when you get there . "
30868	30900	30862	30862	she	1113	" Now , you two -- this year , you behave yourselves . If I get one more owl telling me you 've -- you 've blown up a toilet or -- "
30901	30915	30862	30862	she	1113	" Blown up a toilet ? We 've never blown up a toilet . "
30916	30925	30862	30862	she	1113	" Great idea though , thanks , Mom . "
30926	30937	30862	30862	she	1113	" It 's not funny . And look after Ron . "
30938	30950	30862	30862	she	1113	" Do n't worry , ickle Ronniekins is safe with us . "
30951	30955	30957	30957	Ron	194	" Shut up , "
30982	30999	30960	30960	He	194	" Hey , Mom , guess what ? Guess who we just met on the train ? "
31012	31033	31000	31000	Harry	95	" You know that black - haired boy who was near us in the station ? Know who he is ? "
31034	31037	31045	31047	the little girl	1128	" Who ? "
31038	31042	31000	31000	Harry	95	" Harry Potter ! "
31051	31071	31045	31047	the little girl	1128	" Oh , Mom , can I go on the train and see him , Mom , eh please .... "
31072	31106	31045	31047	the little girl	1128	" You 've already seen him , Ginny , and the poor boy is n't something you goggle at in a zoo . Is he really , Fred ? How do you know ? "
31107	31123	31045	31047	the little girl	1128	" Asked him . Saw his scar . It 's really there - like lightning . "
31124	31152	31045	31047	the little girl	1128	" Poor dear - no wonder he was alone , I wondered . He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform . "
31153	31172	31045	31047	the little girl	1128	" Never mind that , do you think he remembers what You - Know - Who looks like ? "
31180	31211	31173	31174	Their mother	1113	" I forbid you to ask him , Fred . No , do n't you dare . As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school . "
31212	31221	31173	31174	Their mother	1113	" All right , keep your hair on . "
31226	31230	31231	31232	their mother	1113	" Hurry up ! "
31267	31281	31231	31232	their mother	1113	" Do n't , Ginny , we 'll send you loads of owls . "
31282	31292	31251	31251	her	1113	" We 'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat . "
31293	31296	31231	31232	their mother	1113	" George ! "
31297	31303	31251	31251	her	1113	" Only joking , Mom . "
31414	31419	31420	31420	he	95	" Anyone sitting there ? "
31430	31436	31420	31420	he	95	" Everywhere else is full . "
31478	31483	31447	31447	He	95	" Hey , Ron . "
31489	31512	31484	31485	The twins	1100	" Listen , we 're going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordan 's got a giant tarantula down there . "
31513	31516	31518	31518	Ron	194	" Right , "
31520	31523	31525	31527	the other twin	1104	" Harry , "
31529	31553	31525	31527	the other twin	1104	" did we introduce ourselves ? Fred and George Weasley . And this is Ron , our brother . See you later , then .
31554	31557	31559	31559	Harry	95	" Bye , "
31573	31580	31581	31581	Ron	194	" Are you really Harry Potter ? "
31588	31605	31607	31607	Ron	194	" Oh -well , I thought it might be one of Fred and George 's jokes , "
31609	31619	31607	31607	Ron	194	" And have you really got -- you know ... "
31641	31650	31638	31638	Ron	194	" So that 's where You - Know - Who
31651	31654	31656	31656	Harry	95	" Yes , "
31658	31666	31656	31656	Harry	95	" but I ca n't remember it . "
31667	31670	31672	31672	Ron	194	" Nothing ? "
31675	31690	31656	31656	Harry	95	" Well -- I remember a lot of green light , but nothing else . "
31691	31694	31696	31696	Ron	194	" Wow , "
31731	31738	31740	31740	Harry	95	" Are all your family wizards ? "
31753	31762	31764	31764	Ron	194	" Er -- Yes , I think so , "
31766	31787	31764	31764	Ron	194	" I think Mom 's got a second cousin who 's an accountant , but we never talk about him . "
31788	31798	31799	31800	The Weasleys	202	" So you must know loads of magic already . "
31819	31829	31831	31831	Ron	194	" I heard you went to live with Muggles , "
31833	31839	31831	31831	Ron	194	" What are they like ? "
31840	31867	31764	31764	Ron	194	" Horrible -well , not all of them . My aunt and uncle and cousin are , though . Wish I 'd had three wizard brothers . "
31868	31871	31873	31873	Ron	194	" Five , "
31884	32016	31879	31879	he	194	" I 'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts . You could say I 've got a lot to live up to . Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch . Now Percy 's a prefect . Fred and George mess around a lot , but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they 're really funny . Everyone expects me to do as well as the others , but if I do , it 's no big deal , because they did it first . You never get anything new , either , with five brothers . I 've got Bill 's old robes , Charlie 's old wand , and Percy 's old rat . "
32034	32077	32017	32017	Ron	194	" His name 's Scabbers and he 's useless , he hardly ever wakes up . Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect , but they could n't aff -- I mean , I got Scabbers instead . "
32168	32192	32140	32140	he	95	" ... and until Hagrid told me , I did n't know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort "
32196	32199	32201	32201	Harry	95	" What ? "
32203	32214	32216	32216	Ron	194	" You said You - Know - Who 's name ! "
32224	32235	32216	32216	Ron	194	" I 'd have thought you , of all people -- "
32236	32251	32253	32253	Harry	95	" I 'm not trying to be brave or anything , saying the name , "
32278	32297	32275	32275	I	0	" he added , voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately , "
32308	32308	32298	32298	I	0	"
32309	32331	32275	32275	I	0	" You wo n't be . There 's loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough . "
32400	32408	32388	32392	a smiling , dimpled woman	1157	" Anything off the cart , dears ? "
32580	32586	32563	32563	Harry	95	" Hungry , are you ? "
32587	32590	32592	32592	Harry	95	" Starving , "
32630	32641	32621	32621	He	194	" She always forgets I do n't like corned beef . "
32642	32650	32652	32652	Harry	95	" Swap you for one of these , "
32659	32663	32652	32652	Harry	95	" Go on -- "
32664	32676	32678	32678	Ron	194	" You do n't want this , it 's all dry , "
32680	32688	32689	32689	he	194	" She has n't got much time , "
32693	32702	32689	32689	he	194	" you know , with five of us . "
32703	32711	32713	32713	Harry	95	" Go on , have a pasty , "
32764	32769	32770	32770	Harry	95	" What are these ? "
32782	32792	32772	32772	Ron	194	" They 're not really frogs , are they ? "
32804	32807	32809	32809	Ron	194	" No , "
32811	32824	32809	32809	Ron	194	" But see what the card is . I 'm missing Agrippa . "
32825	32828	32772	32772	Ron	194	" What ? "
32829	32875	32809	32809	Ron	194	" Oh , of course , you would n't know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards , inside them , you know , to collect -- famous witches and wizards . I 've got about five hundred , but I have n't got Agrippa or Ptolemy . "
32926	32932	32934	32934	Harry	95	" So this is Dumbledore ! "
32936	32948	32950	32950	Ron	194	" Do n't tell me you 'd never heard of Dumbledore ! "
32952	32964	32950	32950	Ron	194	" Can I have a frog ? I might get Agrippa -- thanks
33057	33062	33037	33037	Harry	95	" He 's gone ! "
33063	33077	33079	33079	Ron	194	" Well , you ca n't expect him to hang around all day , "
33081	33113	33079	33079	Ron	194	" He 'll be back . No , I 've got Morgana again and I 've got about six of her ... do you want it ? You can start collecting . "
33129	33133	33135	33135	Harry	95	" Help yourself , "
33137	33155	33135	33135	Harry	95	" But in , you know , the Muggle world , people just stay put in photos . "
33156	33169	33170	33170	Ron	194	" Do they ? What , they do n't move at all ? "
33174	33177	33170	33170	Ron	194	" weird ! "
33278	33287	33288	33288	Ron	194	" You want to be careful with those , "
33292	33342	33290	33290	Harry	95	" When they say every flavor , they mean every flavor -- you know , you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade , but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe . George reckons he had a booger- flavored one once . "
33361	33368	33343	33343	Ron	194	" Bleaaargh -- see ? Sprouts . "
33486	33489	33490	33490	he	1176	" Sorry , "
33493	33503	33490	33490	he	1176	" but have you seen a toad at all ? "
33513	33526	33510	33510	he	1176	" I 've lost him ! He keeps getting away from me ! "
33527	33533	33535	33535	Harry	95	" He 'll turn up , "
33537	33540	33542	33543	the boy	436	" Yes , "
33546	33554	33542	33543	the boy	436	" Well , if you see him ... "
33558	33568	33570	33570	Ron	194	" Do n't know why he 's so bothered , "
33572	33602	33570	33570	Ron	194	" If I 'd brought a toad I 'd lose it as quick as I could . Mind you , I brought Scabbers , so I ca n't talk . "
33613	33626	33628	33628	Ron	194	" He might have died and you would n't know the difference , "
33632	33660	33628	33628	Ron	194	" I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting , but the spell did n't work . I 'll show you , look ... "
33691	33699	33700	33700	He	194	" Unicorn hair 's nearly poking out . Anyway
33740	33752	33753	33753	she	1179	" Has anyone seen a toad ? Neville 's lost one , "
33776	33788	33790	33790	Ron	194	" We 've already told him we have n't seen it , "
33809	33824	33799	33799	she	1140	" Oh , are you doing magic ? Let 's see it , then . "
33834	33840	33829	33829	Ron	194	" Er -- all right . "
33846	33862	33843	33843	his	194	" Sunshine , daisies , butter mellow , Turn this stupid , fat rat yellow . "
33879	33889	33891	33892	the girl	1140	" Are you sure that 's a real spell ? "
33894	34006	33891	33892	the girl	1140	" Well , it 's not very good , is it ? I 've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it 's all worked for me . Nobody in my family 's magic at all , it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter , but I was ever so pleased , of course , I mean , it 's the very best school of witchcraft there is , I 've heard -- I 've learned all our course books by heart , of course , I just hope it will be enough -- I 'm Hermione Granger , by the way , who are you .
34041	34047	34048	34048	Ron	194	" I 'm Ron Weasley , "
34051	34055	34057	34057	Harry	95	" Harry Potter , "
34059	34064	34066	34066	Hermione	219	" Are you really ? "
34068	34113	34066	34066	Hermione	219	" I know all about you , of course -- I got a few extra books . for background reading , and you 're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century .
34114	34118	34120	34120	Harry	95	" Am I ? "
34125	34146	34148	34148	Hermione	219	" Goodness , did n't you know , I 'd have found out everything I could if it was me , "
34150	34232	34148	34148	Hermione	219	" Do either of you know what house you 'll be in ? I 've been asking around , and I hope I 'm in Gryffindor , it sounds by far the best ; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it , but I suppose Ravenclaw would n't be too bad .... Anyway , we 'd better go and look for Neville 's toad . You two had better change , you know , I expect we 'll be there soon . "
34244	34259	34261	34261	Ron	194	" Whatever house I 'm in , I hope she 's not in it , "
34272	34290	34263	34263	He	194	" Stupid spell -- George gave it to me , bet he knew it was a dud . "
34291	34299	34301	34301	Harry	95	" What house are your brothers in ? "
34303	34306	34308	34308	Ron	194	" Gryffindor , "
34319	34361	34310	34310	Gloom	221	" Mom and Dad were in it , too . I do n't know what they 'll say if I 'm not . I do n't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad , but imagine if they put me in Slytherin . "
34362	34380	34417	34417	Harry	95	" That 's the house Vol- , I mean , You - Know - Who was in ? "
34381	34384	34386	34386	Ron	194	" Yeah , "
34398	34415	34417	34417	Harry	95	" You know , I think the ends of Scabbers ' whiskers are a bit lighter , "
34428	34444	34417	34417	Harry	95	" So what do your oldest brothers do now that they 've left , anyway ? "
34458	34476	34478	34478	Ron	194	" Charlie 's in Romania studying dragons , and Bill 's in Africa doing something for Gringotts , "
34480	34484	34478	34478	Ron	194	" Did you hear about
34517	34517	34508	34508	someone	715	"
34521	34529	34518	34518	Harry	95	" Really ? What happened to them ? "
34530	34601	34602	34602	Harry	95	" Nothing , that 's why it 's such big news . They have n't been caught . My dad says it must 've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts , but they do n't think they took anything , that 's what 's odd . ' Course , everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You - Know - Who 's behind it . "
34650	34652	34602	34602	Harry	95	" Voldemort "
34656	34663	34664	34664	Ron	194	" What 's your Quidditch team ? "
34667	34676	34677	34677	Harry	95	" Er -- I do n't know any , "
34680	34683	34684	34684	Ron	194	" What ! "
34688	34703	34684	34684	Ron	194	" Oh , you wait , it 's the best game in the world -- "
34827	34832	34833	34833	he	194	" Is it true ? "
34836	34860	34833	34833	he	194	" They 're saying all down the train that Harry Potter 's in this compartment . So it 's you , is it ? "
34861	34864	34866	34866	Harry	95	" Yes , "
34900	34911	34913	34915	the pale boy	1198	" Oh , this is Crabbe and this is Goyle , "
34924	34934	34913	34915	the pale boy	1198	" And my name 's Malfoy , Draco Malfoy . "
34955	34994	34995	34995	He	224	" Think my name 's funny , do you ? No need to ask who you are . My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair , freckles , and more children than they can afford . "
35001	35037	34995	34995	He	224	" You 'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others , Potter . You do n't want to go making friends with the wrong sort . I can help you there . "
35055	35071	35072	35072	he	224	" I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself , thanks , "
35093	35105	35106	35106	he	224	" I 'd be careful if I were you , Potter , "
35110	35159	35106	35106	he	224	" Unless you 're a bit politer you 'll go the same way as your parents . They did n't know what was good for them , either . You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid , and it 'll rub off on you . "
35167	35172	35173	35173	Ron	194	" Say that again , "
35184	35197	35198	35198	Malfoy	224	" Oh , you 're going to fight us , are you ? "
35201	35208	35210	35210	Harry	95	" Unless you get out now , "
35231	35259	35260	35260	Goyle	223	" But we do n't feet like leaving , do we , boys ? We 've eaten all our food and you still seem to have some . "
35374	35381	35382	35382	she	219	" What has been going on ? "
35410	35422	35402	35402	I	0	" Ron said to Harry . He looked closer at Scabbers . "
35437	35437	35431	35431	he	194	"
35443	35450	35402	35402	I	0	" You 've met Malfoy before ? "
35460	35468	35470	35470	Ron	194	" I 've heard of his family , "
35473	35525	35526	35526	He	194	" They were some of the first to come back to our side after You - Know - Who disappeared . Said they 'd been bewitched . My dad does n't believe it . He says Malfoy 's father did n't need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side . "
35531	35539	35526	35526	He	194	" Can we help you with something ? "
35540	35593	35647	35647	Hermione	219	" You 'd better hurry up and put your robes on , I 've just been up to the front to ask the conductor , and he says we 're nearly there . You have n't been fighting , have you ? You 'll be in trouble before we even get there ! "
35594	35603	35605	35605	Ron	194	" Scabbers has been fighting , not us , "
35611	35620	35605	35605	Ron	194	" Would you mind leaving while we change ? "
35621	35645	35647	35647	Hermione	219	" All right -- I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly , racing up and down the corridors , "
35653	35671	35647	35647	Hermione	219	" And you 've got dirt on your nose , by the way , did you know ? "
35752	35781	35728	35728	Ron	194	" We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes ' time . Please leave your luggage on the train , it will be taken to the school separately . "
35871	35888	35889	35889	Hagrid	282	" Firs ' years ! Firs ' years over here ! All right there , Harry ? "

36583	36588	36590	36591	Professor McGonagall	109	" Welcome to Hogwarts , "
36593	36675	36590	36591	Professor McGonagall	109	" The start - of - term banquet will begin shortly , but before you take your seats in the Great Hall , you will be sorted into your houses . The Sorting is a very important ceremony because , while you are here , your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts . You will have classes with the rest of your house , sleep in your house dormitory , and spend free time in your house common room .
36676	36766	36852	36853	Professor McGonagall	109	" The four houses are called Gryffindor , Hufflepuff , Ravenclaw , and Slytherin . Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards . While you are at Hogwarts , your triumphs will earn your house points , while any rulebreaking will lose house points . At the end of the year , the house with the most points is awarded the house cup , a great honor . I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours .
36767	36804	36805	36805	Her	1252	" The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school . I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting . "
36839	36850	36852	36853	Professor McGonagall	109	" I shall return when we are ready for you , "
36855	36860	36852	36853	Professor McGonagall	109	" Please wait quietly . "
36869	36879	36880	36880	he	109	" How exactly do they sort us into houses ? "
36884	36907	36882	36882	Ron	194	" Some sort of test , I think . Fred said it hurts a lot , but I think he was joking . "
37089	37094	37083	37086	several people behind him	1260	" What the -- ? "
37156	37173	37149	37152	a fat little monk	1265	" Forgive and forget , I say , we ought to give him a second chance -- "
37174	37219	37149	37152	a fat little monk	1265	" My dear Friar , have n't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves ? He gives us all a bad name and you know , he 's not really even a ghost -- I say , what are you all doing here ? "
37237	37241	37243	37245	the Fat Friar	1268	" New students ! "
37252	37261	37243	37245	the Fat Friar	1268	" About to be Sorted , I suppose ? "

37290	37295	37340	37342	the first years	1272	" Move along now , "
37301	37310	37340	37342	the first years	1272	" The Sorting Ceremony 's about to start . "
37329	37336	37337	37338	Professor McGonagall	109	" Now , form a line , "
37344	37349	37337	37338	Professor McGonagall	109	" and follow me . "

38121	38143	38144	38144	she	1307	" When I call your name , you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted , "

40147	40178	40145	40145	Seamus	243	" Me dad 's a Muggle . Mom did n't tell him she was a witch ' til after they were married . Bit of a nasty shock for him . "
40183	40190	40192	40192	Ron	194	" What about you , Neville ? "
40194	40208	40210	40210	Neville	197	" Well , my gran brought me up and she 's a witch , "
40212	40372	40210	40210	Neville	197	" but the family thought I was all- Muggle for ages . My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once , I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight . Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner , and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go . But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road . They were all really pleased , Gran was crying , she was so happy . And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come , you see . Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad . "
40388	40430	40379	40380	Percy Weasley	191	" I do hope they start right away , there 's so much to learn , I 'm particularly interested in Transfiguration , you know , turning something into something else , of course , it 's supposed to be very difficult- "
40432	40449	40379	40380	Percy Weasley	191	" You 'll be starting small , just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- "
40549	40552	40553	40553	Harry	109	" Ouch ! "
40561	40566	40568	40568	Percy	191	" What is it ? "
40570	40575	40553	40553	Harry	109	" N - nothing . "
40614	40624	40625	40625	he	191	" Who 's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell ? "
40629	40684	40606	40606	he	109	" Oh , you know Quirrell already , do you ? No wonder he 's looking so nervous , that 's Professor Snape . He teaches Potions , but he does n't want to -- everyone knows he 's after Quirrell 's job . Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts , Snape . "
40723	40753	40693	40693	Snape	265	" Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered . I have a few start - of - term notices to give you .
40754	40787	40693	40693	Snape	265	" First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils . And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well . "
40801	40829	40788	40788	Dumbledore	118	" I have also been asked by Mr. Filch , the caretaker , to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors .
40830	40856	40693	40693	Snape	265	" Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term . Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch .
40857	40897	40788	40788	Dumbledore	118	" And finally , I must tell you that this year , the third - floor corridor on the right - hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death . "
40911	40917	40918	40918	he	109	" He 's not serious ? "
40923	40927	40929	40929	Percy	191	" Must be , "
40935	40981	40929	40929	Percy	191	" It 's odd , because he usually gives us a reason why we 're not allowed to go somewhere -- the forest 's full of dangerous beasts , everyone knows that . I do think he might have told us prefects , at least . "
40982	40999	41001	41001	Dumbledore	118	" And now , before we go to bed , let us sing the school song ! "
41062	41069	41071	41071	Dumbledore	118	" Everyone pick their favorite tune , "
41073	41079	41071	41071	Dumbledore	118	" and off we go ! "
41085	41093	41071	41071	Dumbledore	118	" Hogwarts , Hogwarts , Hoggy Warty Hogwarts ,
41222	41227	41228	41228	he	118	" Ah , music , "
41235	41253	41228	41228	he	118	" A magic beyond all we do here ! And now , bedtime . Off you trot ! "

41516	41533	41535	41535	Percy	191	" Go away , Peeves , or the Baron'll hear about this , I mean it ! "
41568	41577	41579	41579	Percy	191	" You want to watch out for Peeves , "
41587	41613	41579	41579	Percy	191	" The Bloody Baron 's the only one who can control him , he wo n't even listen to us prefects . Here we are . "

41983	41986	42023	42023	Harry	109	" Where ? "
41987	41998	42035	42039	People lining up outside classrooms	1382	" Next to the tall kid with the red hair . "
41999	42004	42023	42023	Harry	109	" Wearing the glasses ? "
42005	42012	42035	42039	People lining up outside classrooms	1382	" Did you see his face ? "
42013	42020	42023	42023	Harry	109	" Did you see his scar ? "
42316	42321	42333	42334	the caretaker	2901	" GOT YOUR CONK ! "
42846	42863	42864	42864	she	1411	" Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts , "
42867	42886	42864	42864	she	1411	" Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back . You have been warned . "
43256	43263	43264	43264	Harry	109	" What have we got today ? "
43275	43282	43284	43284	Ron	194	" Double Potions with the Slytherins , "
43286	43312	43284	43284	Ron	194	" Snape 's Head of Slytherin House . They say he always favors them -- we 'll be able to see if it 's true . "
43313	43319	43321	43321	Harry	109	" Wish McGonagall favored us , "
43710	43715	43716	43716	he	265	" Ah , Yes , "
43720	43729	43716	43716	he	265	" Harry Potter . Our new -- celebrity . "
43785	43800	43801	43801	he	265	" You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking , "
43846	43939	43834	43834	Snape	265	" As there is little foolish wand - waving here , many of you will hardly believe this is magic . I do n't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes , the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins , bewitching the mind , ensnaring the senses .... I can teach you how to bottle fame , brew glory , even stopper death -- if you are n't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach . "
43978	43981	43983	43983	Snape	265	" Potter ! "
43986	44004	43983	43983	Snape	265	" What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood ? "
44037	44045	44047	44047	Harry	95	" I do n't know , sit , "
44057	44068	44069	44069	He	265	" Tut , tut -- fame clearly is n't everything . "
44075	44097	44069	44069	He	265	" Let 's try again . Potter , where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar ? "
44149	44157	44141	44141	Goyle	223	" I do n't know , sit . "
44158	44173	44174	44174	Harry	95	" Thought you would n't open a book before coming , eh , Potter ? "
44222	44235	44213	44213	Snape	265	" What is the difference , Potter , between monkshood and wolfsbane ? "
44251	44257	44259	44259	Harry	95	" I do n't know , "
44262	44277	44259	44259	Harry	95	" I think Hermione does , though , why do n't you try her ? "
44301	44305	44306	44306	he	265	" Sit down , "
44311	44390	44306	44306	he	265	" For your information , Potter , asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death . A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons . As for monkshood and wolfsbane , they are the same plant , which also goes by the name of aconite . Well ? Why are n't you all copying that down ? "
44408	44424	44405	44405	Snape	265	" And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek , Potter . "
44592	44596	44598	44598	Snape	265	" Idiot boy ! "
44612	44628	44598	44598	Snape	265	" I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire ? "
44642	44651	44652	44652	Snape	265	" Take him up to the hospital wing , "
44673	44716	44658	44658	he	265	" You -- Potter -- why did n't you tell him not to add the quills ? Thought he 'd make you look good if he got it wrong , did you ? That 's another point you 've lost for Gryffindor . "
44737	44743	44744	44744	he	194	" Doi * push it , "
44747	44757	44744	44744	he	194	" I 've heard Snape can turn very nasty . "
44803	44807	44809	44809	Ron	194	" Cheer up , "
44811	44831	44809	44809	Ron	194	" Snape 's always taking points off Fred and George . Can I come and meet Hagrid with you ? "
44900	44907	44892	44892	Hagrid	282	" Back , Fang -- back . "
44925	44929	44930	44930	he	282	" Hang on , "
44933	44938	44930	44930	he	282	" Back , Fang . "
44999	45005	45007	45007	Hagrid	282	" Make yerselves at home , "
45038	45043	45044	45044	Harry	282	" This is Ron , "
45065	45071	45073	45073	Hagrid	282	" Another Weasley , eh ? "
45096	45096	45081	45081	I	0	"
45155	45160	45152	45152	Hagrid	282	" that old git . "
45161	45213	45216	45216	Hagrid	282	" An ' as fer that cat , Mrs. Norris , I 'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime . D'yeh know , every time I go up ter the school , she follows me everywhere ? Ca n't get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it . "
45244	45253	45222	45222	Hagrid	282	" But he seemed to really hate me . "
45254	45257	45259	45259	Hagrid	282	" Rubbish ! "
45261	45266	45259	45259	Hagrid	282	" Why should he ? "
45286	45293	45294	45294	Hagrid	282	" How 's yer brother Charlie ? "
45298	45309	45296	45296	Ron	194	" I liked him a lot -- great with animals . "
45415	45441	45443	45445	a Gringotts spokesgoblin	24	" But we 're not telling you what was in there , so keep your noses out if you know what 's good for you , "
45473	45476	45478	45478	Harry	282	" Hagrid ! "
45480	45501	45478	45478	Harry	282	" that Gringotts break - in happened on my birthday ! It might 've been happening while we were there ! "
45761	45764	45766	45766	Harry	282	" Typical , "
45769	45790	45766	45766	Harry	282	" Just what I always wanted . To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy . "
45805	45819	45821	45821	Ron	194	" You do n't know that you 'll make a fool of yourself , "
45824	45850	45821	45821	Ron	194	" Anyway , I know Malfoy 's always going on about how good he is at Quidditch , but I bet that 's all talk . "
46253	46259	46260	46260	he	197	" It 's a Remembrall ! "
46263	46299	46260	46260	he	197	" Gran knows I forget things -- this tells you if there 's something you 've forgotten to do . Look , you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -- oh ... "
46312	46318	46329	46330	Draco Malfoy	224	" You 've forgotten something ... "
46388	46394	46367	46368	Professor McGonagall	109	" What 's going on ? "
46395	46404	46422	46422	he	224	" Malfoy 's got my Remembrall , Professor . "
46417	46421	46422	46422	he	224	" Just looking , "
46590	46600	46601	46601	she	268	" Well , what are you all waiting for ? "
46604	46617	46601	46601	she	268	" Everyone stand by a broomstick . Come on , hurry up . "
46639	46649	46651	46652	Madam Hooch	268	" Stick out your right hand over your broom , "
46657	46663	46651	46652	Madam Hooch	268	" and say ' Up ! "
46665	46669	46651	46652	Madam Hooch	268	" UPF everyone shouted .
46795	46813	46815	46816	Madam Hooch	268	" Now , when I blow my whistle , you kick off from the ground , hard , "
46818	46848	46815	46816	Madam Hooch	268	" Keep your brooms steady , rise a few feet , and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly . On my whistle -- three -- two -- "
46877	46883	46884	46884	she	268	" Come back , boy ! "
46989	46993	46996	46996	her	268	" Broken wrist , "
46999	47014	46996	46996	her	268	" Come on , boy -- it 's all right , up you get . "
47025	47069	47016	47016	She	268	" None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing ! You leave those brooms where they are or you 'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ' Quidditch . ' Come on , dear . "
47108	47119	47103	47103	Malfoy	224	" Did you see his face , the great lump ? "
47126	47132	47134	47135	Parvati Patil	248	" Shut up , Malfoy , "
47137	47145	47147	47148	Pansy Parkinson	247	" Ooh , sticking up for Longbottom ? "
47157	47169	47147	47148	Pansy Parkinson	247	" Never thought you 'd like fat little crybabies , Parvati . "
47170	47173	47175	47175	Malfoy	224	" Look ! "
47187	47199	47175	47175	Malfoy	224	" It 's that stupid thing Longbottom 's gran sent him . "
47212	47219	47221	47221	Harry	109	" Give that here , Malfoy , "
47234	47254	47230	47230	Malfoy	224	" I think I 'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about -- up a tree ? "
47255	47260	47261	47261	Harry	109	" Give it here ! "
47298	47306	47295	47295	he	224	" Come and get it , Potter ! "
47312	47315	47317	47318	Hermione Granger	219	" No ! "
47320	47337	47317	47318	Hermione Granger	219	" Madam Hooch told us not to move -- you 'll get us all into trouble . "
47453	47458	47459	47459	Harry	95	" Give it here , "
47462	47472	47459	47459	Harry	95	" or I 'll knock you off that broom ! "
47473	47478	47480	47480	Malfoy	224	" Oh , yeah ? "
47551	47565	47566	47566	Harry	95	" No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck , Malfoy , "
47578	47587	47588	47588	he	95	" Catch it if you can , then ! "
47709	47713	47694	47694	he	95	" HARRY POTTER ! "
47739	47749	47731	47731	He	109	" Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts -- "
47764	47776	47759	47759	her	1523	" -- how dare you -- might have broken your neck -- "
47777	47786	47759	47759	her	1523	" It was n't his fault , Professor -- "
47787	47792	47759	47759	her	1523	" Be quiet , Miss Patil
47793	47797	47759	47759	her	1523	" But Malfoy -- "
47798	47813	47759	47759	her	1523	" That 's enough , Mr. Weasley . Potter , follow me , now . "
48045	48060	48041	48041	her	1523	" Excuse me , Professor Flitwick , could I borrow Wood for a moment ? "
48104	48111	48113	48114	Professor McGonagall	109	" Follow me , you two , "
48130	48134	48124	48124	Wood	290	" In here . "
48159	48164	48165	48165	she	1523	" Out , Peeves ! "
48201	48218	48186	48187	Professor McGonagall	109	" Potter , this is Oliver Wood . Wood -- I 've found you a Seeker . "
48228	48235	48186	48187	Professor McGonagall	109	" Are you serious , Professor ? "
48236	48239	48241	48242	Professor McGonagall	109	" Absolutely , "
48245	48271	48241	48242	Professor McGonagall	109	" The boy 's a natural . I 've never seen anything like it . Was that your first time on a broomstick , Potter ? "
48309	48324	48325	48326	Professor McGonagall	109	" He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty - foot dive , "
48330	48345	48325	48326	Professor McGonagall	109	" Did n't even scratch himself . Charlie Weasley could n't have done it . "
48361	48371	48372	48372	he	290	" Ever seen a game of Quidditch , Potter ? "
48376	48385	48386	48387	Professor McGonagall	109	" Wood 's captain of the Gryffindor team , "
48390	48402	48404	48404	Wood	290	" He 's just the build for a Seeker , too , "
48415	48445	48404	48404	Wood	290	" Light -- speedy -- we 'll have to get him a decent broom , Professor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven , I 'd say . "
48497	48497	48485	48485	I	0	"
48508	48530	48498	48499	Professor McGonagall	109	" I want to hear you 're training hard , Potter , or I may change my mind about punishing you . "
48536	48544	48545	48545	she	1541	" Your father would have been proud , "
48548	48557	48532	48532	she	1541	" He was an excellent Quidditch player himself . "
48558	48563	48532	48532	she	1541	" You 're joking . "
48609	48612	48613	48613	he	194	" Seeker ? "
48616	48654	48613	48613	he	194	" But first years never -- you must be the youngest house player in about a century , said Harry , shoveling pie into his mouth . He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon . "
48659	48659	48655	48655	Wood	290	"
48676	48683	48685	48685	Harry	109	" I start training next week , "
48687	48702	48685	48685	Harry	109	" Only do n't tell anyone , Wood wants to keep it a secret . "
48720	48724	48726	48726	George	193	" Well done , "
48732	48746	48726	48726	George	193	" Wood told us . We 're on the team too -- Beaters . "
48747	48765	48767	48767	Fred	192	" I tell you , we 're going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year , "
48769	48805	48767	48767	Fred	192	" We have n't won since Charlie left , but this year 's team is going to be brilliant . You must be good , Harry , Wood was almost skipping when he told us . "
48806	48830	48726	48726	George	193	" Anyway , we 've got to go , Lee Jordan reckons he 's found a new secret passageway out of the school . "
48831	48855	48767	48767	Fred	192	" Bet it 's that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week . See you . "
48878	48897	48767	48767	Fred	192	" Having a last meal , Potter ? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles ? "
48898	48922	48924	48924	Harry	95	" You 're a lot braver now that you 're back on the ground and you 've got your little friends with you , "
48963	48974	48976	48976	Malfoy	224	" I 'd take you on anytime on my own , "
48978	49012	48976	48976	Malfoy	224	" Tonight , if you want . Wizard 's duel . Wands only -- no contact . What 's the matter ? Never heard of a wizard 's duel before , I suppose ? "
49013	49019	49021	49021	Ron	194	" Of course he has , "
49026	49036	49021	49021	Ron	194	" I 'm his second , who 's yours ? "
49048	49051	49052	49052	he	224	" Crabbe , "
49055	49074	49052	49052	he	224	" Midnight all right ? We 'll meet you in the trophy room ; that 's always unlocked . "
49088	49096	49098	49098	Harry	95	" What is a wizard 's duel ? "
49100	49112	49098	49098	Harry	95	" And what do you mean , you 're my second ? "
49113	49127	49129	49129	Ron	194	" Well , a second 's there to take over if you die , "
49153	49207	49149	49149	he	194	" But people only die in proper duels , you know , with real wizards . The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send sparks at each other . Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage . I bet he expected you to refuse , anyway . "
49208	49220	49149	49149	he	194	" And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens ? "
49221	49232	49233	49233	Ron	194	" Throw it away and punch him on the nose , "
49236	49240	49233	49233	Ron	194	" Excuse me . "
49251	49263	49265	49265	Ron	194	" Ca n't a person eat in peace in this place ? "
49275	49288	49267	49267	Hermione	219	" I could n't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying -- "
49289	49294	49295	49295	Ron	194	" Bet you could , "
49298	49339	49267	49267	Hermione	219	" --and you must n't go wandering around the school at night , think of the points you 'll lose Gryffindor if you 're caught , and you 're bound to be . It 's really very selfish of you . "
49340	49350	49352	49352	Harry	95	" And it 's really none of your business , "
49354	49359	49361	49361	Ron	194	" Good - bye , "
49418	49442	49408	49408	Ron	194	" If he tries to curse you , you 'd better dodge it , because I ca n't remember how to block them . "
49512	49518	49519	49519	Ron	194	" Half - past eleven , "
49524	49530	49519	49519	Ron	194	" we 'd better go . "
49597	49611	49688	49688	he	95	" I ca n't believe you 're going to do this , Harry . "
49630	49633	49635	49635	Ron	194	" You ! "
49638	49644	49635	49635	Ron	194	" Go back to bed ! "
49645	49652	49653	49653	Hermione	219	" I almost told your brother , "
49656	49672	49653	49653	Hermione	219	" Percy -- he 's a prefect , he 'd put a stop to this . "
49683	49687	49688	49688	he	95	" Come on , "
49734	49778	49718	49718	She	219	" Do n't you care about Gryffindor , do you only care about yourselves , I do n't want Slytherin to win the house cup , and you 'll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells . "
49779	49783	49718	49718	She	219	" Go away . "
49784	49812	49718	49718	She	219	" All right , but I warned you , you just remember what I said when you 're on the train home tomorrow , you 're so -- "
49864	49873	49874	49874	she	219	" Now what am I going to do ? "
49878	49884	49886	49886	Ron	194	" That 's your problem , "
49888	49903	49886	49886	Ron	194	" We 've got to go , we 3 re going to be late . "
49921	49928	49929	49929	she	219	" I 'm coming with you , "
49932	49937	49886	49886	Ron	194	" You are not . "
49938	49985	49886	49886	Ron	194	" D'you think I 'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me ? If he finds all three of us I 'll tell him the truth , that I was trying to stop you , and you can back me up . "
49986	49993	49995	49995	Ron	194	" You 've got some nerve -- "
49998	50006	50008	50008	Harry	109	" Shut up , both of you ! "
50015	50015	49886	49886	Ron	194	"
50023	50027	50029	50029	Ron	194	" Mrs. Norris ? "
50066	50094	50039	50040	Mrs. Norris	274	" Thank goodness you found me ! I 've been out here for hours , I could n't remember the new password to get in to bed . "
50095	50126	50039	50040	Mrs. Norris	274	" Keep your voice down , Neville . The password 's ' Pig snout ' but it wo n't help you now , the Fat Lady 's gone off somewhere . "
50127	50133	50135	50135	Harry	109	" How 's your arm ? "
50137	50140	50142	50142	Neville	197	" Fine , "
50147	50157	50142	50142	Neville	197	" Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute . "
50158	50180	50039	50040	Mrs. Norris	274	" Good - well , look , Neville , we 've got to be somewhere , we 'll see you later -- "
50181	50187	50189	50189	Neville	197	" Do n't leave me ! "
50196	50215	50189	50189	Neville	197	" I do n't want to stay here alone , the Bloody Baron 's been past twice already . "
50230	50262	50216	50216	Ron	194	" If either of you get us caught , I 'll never rest until I 've learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about , and used it on you .
50418	50429	50430	50430	Ron	194	" He 's late , maybe he 's chickened out , "
50462	50477	50454	50454	someone	715	" Sniff around , my sweet , they might be lurking in a corner . "
50536	50543	50546	50546	him	109	" They 're in here somewhere , "
50549	50553	50546	50546	him	109	" probably hiding . "
50554	50558	50559	50559	Harry	109	" This way ! "
50635	50638	50639	50639	Harry	109	" RUN ! "
50726	50734	50735	50735	Harry	109	" I think we 've lost him , "
50762	50774	50779	50779	you	109	" Hermione gasped , clutching at the stitch in her chest , "
50781	50781	50775	50775	I	0	"
50782	50793	50795	50795	Ron	194	" We 've got to get back to Gryffindor tower , "
50797	50802	50795	50795	Ron	194	" quickly as possible . "
50803	50808	50809	50809	Hermione	219	" Malfoy tricked you , "
50814	50850	50809	50809	Hermione	219	" You realize that , do n't you ? He was never going to meet you -- Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room , Malfoy must have tipped him off . "
50868	50873	50853	50853	she	219	" Let 's go . "
50925	50940	50913	50913	He	109	" Shut up , Peeves -- please -- you 'll get us thrown out . "
50944	50968	50941	50941	Peeves	230	" Wandering around at midnight , Ickle Firsties ? Tut , tut , tut . Naughty , naughty , you 'll get caughty . "
50969	50983	50913	50913	He	109	" Not if you do n't give us away , Peeves , please . "
50984	50992	50994	50994	Peeves	230	" Should tell Filch , I should , "
51006	51017	51001	51001	his	230	" It 's for your own good , you know . "
51018	51025	51027	51027	Ron	194	" Get out of the way , "
51040	51046	51047	51047	Peeves	230	" STUDENTS OUT OF BED ! "
51050	51059	51047	51047	Peeves	230	" STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR "
51089	51094	51095	51095	Ron	194	" This is it ! "
51106	51117	51095	51095	Ron	194	" We 're done for ! This is the end ! "
51135	51141	51142	51142	Hermione	219	" Oh , move over , "
51161	51161	51145	51145	She	219	"
51189	51198	51199	51199	Filch	273	" Which way did they go , Peeves ? "
51203	51209	51199	51199	Filch	273	" Quick , tell me . "
51210	51215	51145	51145	She	219	" Say ' please . "
51217	51232	51199	51199	Filch	273	" Do n't mess with me , Peeves , now where did they go ? "
51233	51245	51247	51247	Peeves	230	" Sha n't say nothing if you do n't say please , "
51254	51259	51249	51249	his	230	" All right -please . "
51260	51285	51292	51292	Peeves	230	" NOTHING ! Ha haaa ! Told you I would n't say nothing if you did n't say please ! Ha ha ! Haaaaaa ! "
51301	51309	51310	51310	Harry	109	" He thinks this door is locked , "
51313	51326	51310	51310	Harry	109	" I think we 'll be okay -- get off , Neville ! "
51344	51347	51328	51328	Neville	197	" What ? "
51639	51648	51649	51649	she	1595	" Where on earth have you all been ? "
51667	51678	51680	51680	Harry	109	" Never mind that -- pig snout , pig snout , "
51726	51746	51748	51748	Ron	194	" What do they think they 're doing , keeping a thing like that locked up in a school ? "
51751	51762	51748	51748	Ron	194	" If any dog needs exercise , that one does . "
51776	51791	51792	51792	she	219	" You do n't use your eyes , any of you , do you ? "
51795	51805	51792	51792	she	219	" Did n't you see what it was standing on .
51806	51810	51811	51811	Harry	109	" The floor ? "
51814	51831	51811	51811	Harry	109	" I was n't looking at its feet , I was too busy with its heads . "
51832	51852	51853	51853	She	219	" No , not the floor . It was standing on a trapdoor . It 's obviously guarding something . "
51895	51895	51889	51889	I	0	"
51905	51913	51914	51914	he	194	" No , we do n't mind , "
51917	51929	51914	51914	he	194	" You 'd think we dragged her along , would n't you .
52099	52109	52111	52111	Ron	194	" It 's either really valuable or really dangerous , "
52113	52117	52119	52119	Harry	282	" Or both , "
52430	52436	52437	52437	Ron	194	" A Nimbus Two Thousand ! "
52441	52449	52437	52437	Ron	194	" I 've never even touched one . "
52495	52501	52502	52502	he	301	" That 's a broomstick , "
52521	52540	52502	52502	he	301	" You 'll be in for it this time , Potter , first years are n't allowed them . "
52547	52555	52556	52556	he	194	" It 's not any old broomstick , "
52559	52584	52585	52585	Ron	194	" it 's a Nimbus Two Thousand . What did you say you 've got at home , Malfoy , a Comet Two Sixty ? "
52590	52607	52585	52585	Ron	194	" Comets look flashy , but they 're not in the same league as the Nimbus . "
52608	52626	52627	52627	Malfoy	301	" What would you know about it , Weasley , you could n't afford half the handle , "
52631	52646	52627	52627	Malfoy	301	" I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig . "
52660	52669	52670	52670	he	279	" Not arguing , I hope , boys ? "
52673	52683	52685	52685	Malfoy	301	" Potter 's been sent a broomstick , Professor , "
52688	52697	52699	52700	Professor Flitwick	279	" Yes , yes , that 's right , "
52706	52725	52699	52700	Professor Flitwick	279	" Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances , Potter . And what model is it ? "
52726	52734	52736	52736	Harry	95	" A Nimbus Two Thousand , sit , "
52752	52767	52768	52768	he	95	" And it 's really thanks to Malfoy here that I 've got it , "
52788	52795	52796	52796	Harry	95	" Well , it 's true , "
52808	52824	52796	52796	Harry	95	" If he had n't stolen Neville 's Remembrall I wouln't be on the team .... "
52825	52839	52849	52849	Hermione	219	" So I suppose you think that 's a reward for breaking rules ? "
52866	52876	52878	52878	Harry	95	" I thought you were n't speaking to us ? "
52880	52888	52890	52890	Ron	194	" Yes , do n't stop now , "
52892	52901	52890	52890	Ron	194	" it 's doing us so much good . "
52989	52992	52993	52993	Ron	194	" Wow , "
53198	53206	53237	53237	his	290	" Hey , Potter , come down ! '
53229	53233	53235	53235	Wood	290	" Very nice , "
53241	53278	53237	53237	his	290	" I see what McGonagall meant ... you really are a natural . I 'm just going to teach you the rules this evening , then you 'll be joining team practice three times a week . "
53292	53295	53297	53297	Wood	290	" Right , "
53299	53334	53297	53297	Wood	290	" Now , Quidditch is easy enough to understand , even if it 's not too easy to play . There are seven players on each side . Three of them are called Chasers . "
53335	53339	53340	53340	Harry	109	" Three Chasers , "
53359	53367	53369	53369	Wood	290	" This ball 's called the Quaffle , "
53371	53411	53369	53369	Wood	290	" The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal . Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops . Follow me ? "
53412	53427	53428	53428	Harry	109	" The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score , "
53431	53450	53428	53428	Harry	109	" So -- that 's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops , is n't it ? "
53451	53456	53458	53458	Wood	290	" What 's basketball ? "
53461	53465	53467	53467	Harry	109	" Never mind , "
53470	53505	53369	53369	Wood	290	" Now , there 's another player on each side who 's called the Keeper -I'm Keeper for Gryffindor . I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring . "
53506	53513	53515	53515	Harry	109	" Three Chasers , one Keeper , "
53525	53544	53545	53545	He	290	" And they play with the Quaffle . Okay , got that . So what are they for ? "
53556	53563	53565	53565	Wood	290	" I 'll show you now , "
53567	53571	53565	53565	Wood	290	" Take this . "
53587	53599	53600	53600	Wood	290	" I 'm going to show you what the Bludgers do , "
53603	53610	53600	53600	Wood	290	" These two are the Bludgers . "
53646	53650	53651	53651	Wood	290	" Stand back , "
53735	53738	53739	53739	Wood	290	" See ? "
53756	53817	53739	53739	Wood	290	" The Bludgers rocket around , trying to knock players off their brooms . That 's why you have two Beaters on each team -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it 's their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team . So -- think you 've got all that ? "
53818	53845	53846	53846	Harry	109	" Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle ; the Keeper guards the goal posts ; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team , "
53850	53854	53856	53856	Wood	290	" Very good , "
53858	53868	53869	53869	Harry	109	" Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone ? "
53877	53905	53873	53873	he	109	" Never at Hogwarts . We 've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that . Now , the last member of the team is the
53932	53932	53926	53926	they	305	"
53933	53962	53963	53963	Wood	290	" Do n't worry , the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I mean , they 're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves . "
54008	54011	54013	54013	Wood	290	" This , "
54015	54103	54013	54013	Wood	290	" is the Golden Snitch , and it 's the most important ball of the lot . It 's very hard to catch because it 's so fast and difficult to see . It 's the Seeker 's job to catch it . You 've got to weave in and out of the Chasers , Beaters , Bludgers , and Quaffle to get it before the other team 's Seeker , because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points , so they
54160	54170	54145	54145	they	1637	" Well , that 's it -- any questions ? "
54198	54208	54210	54210	Wood	290	" We wo n't practice with the Snitch yet , "
54220	54242	54210	54210	Wood	290	" it 's too dark , we might lose it . Let 's try you out with a few of these . "
54317	54329	54331	54331	Wood	290	" That Quidditch cup'll have our name on it this year , "
54342	54373	54331	54331	Wood	290	" I would n't be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley , and he could have played for England if he had n't gone off chasing dragons . "
54584	54599	54601	54602	Professor Flitwick	279	" Now , do n't forget that nice wrist movement we 've been practicing ! "
54615	54665	54601	54602	Professor Flitwick	279	" Swish and flick , remember , swish and flick . And saying the magic words properly is very important , too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio , who said 's ' instead of ' f ' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest . "
54735	54739	54740	54740	he	194	" Wingardium Leviosa ! "
54751	54758	54761	54761	Hermione	219	" You 're saying it wrong , "
54764	54787	54761	54761	Hermione	219	" It 's Wing - gar - dium Levi - o - sa , make the ' gar ' nice and long . "
54788	54801	54802	54802	Ron	194	" You do it , then , if you 're so clever , "
54821	54825	54805	54805	Hermione	219	" Wingardium Leviosa ! "
54841	54847	54849	54850	Professor Flitwick	279	" Oh , well done ! "
54854	54865	54849	54850	Professor Flitwick	279	" Everyone see here , Miss Granger 's done it ! "
54880	54891	54892	54892	he	194	" It 's no wonder no one can stand her , "
54906	54914	54892	54892	he	194	" she 's a nightmare , honestly . "
54948	54955	54943	54943	she	219	" I think she heard you . "
54956	54959	54961	54961	Ron	194	" So ? "
54970	54981	54964	54964	he	194	" She must 've noticed she 's got no friends . "
55164	55177	55149	55149	he	169	" Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you ought to know . "
55212	55215	55216	55216	he	169	" Prefects , "
55219	55229	55216	55216	he	169	" lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately ! "
55236	55281	55233	55233	his	191	" Follow me ! Stick together , first years ! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders ! Stay close behind me , now . Make way , first years coming through ! Excuse me , I 'm a prefect ! "
55282	55290	55291	55291	Harry	109	" How could a troll get in ? "
55299	55313	55315	55315	Ron	194	" Do n't ask me , they 're supposed to be really stupid , "
55317	55328	55315	55315	Ron	194	" Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke . "
55359	55367	55352	55352	Harry	109	" I 've just thought -- Hermione . "
55368	55373	55352	55352	Harry	109	" What about her ? "
55374	55383	55352	55352	Harry	109	" She does n't know about the troll . "
55389	55395	55396	55396	he	194	" Oh , all right , "
55399	55407	55396	55396	he	194	" But Percy'd better not see us . "
55450	55453	55455	55455	Ron	194	" Percy ! "
55487	55493	55494	55494	Harry	109	" What 's he doing ? "
55497	55513	55494	55494	Harry	109	" Why is n't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers ? "
55514	55518	55530	55530	Snape	265	" Search me . "
55535	55544	55545	55545	Harry	109	" He 's heading for the third floor , "
55555	55561	55549	55549	Ron	194	" Can you smell something ? "
55753	55760	55761	55761	Harry	109	" The keys in the lock , "
55764	55771	55761	55761	Harry	109	" We could lock it in . "
55772	55776	55778	55778	Ron	194	" Good idea , "
55826	55826	55808	55808	Harry	109	"
55875	55880	55882	55882	Ron	194	" Oh , no , "
55890	55898	55899	55899	Harry	109	" It 's the girls ' bathroom ! "
55902	55905	55906	55906	they	1658	" Hermione ! "
55991	55995	55996	55996	Harry	109	" Confuse it ! "
56067	56074	56076	56076	Ron	194	" Oy , pea - brain ! "
56133	56141	56142	56142	Harry	109	" Come on , run , run ! "
56371	56375	56360	56360	himself	194	" Wingardium Leviosa ! "
56476	56482	56471	56471	Hermione	219	" Is it -- dead ? "
56489	56502	56483	56483	I	0	" said Harry , I think it 's just been knocked out . "
56528	56534	56503	56503	He	109	" Urgh -- troll boogers . "
56681	56690	56699	56699	her	1697	" What on earth were you thinking of ? "
56718	56735	56705	56705	Ron	194	" You 're lucky you were n't killed . Why are n't you in your dormitory ? "
56770	56782	56788	56788	Hermione	219	" Please , Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me . "
56783	56787	56788	56788	Hermione	219	" Miss Granger ! "
56830	56830	56823	56823	I	0	"
56847	56900	56836	56837	Hermione Granger	219	" If they had n't found me , I 'd be dead now . Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club . They did n't have time to come and fetch anyone . It was about to finish me off when they arrived . "
56917	56924	56926	56927	Professor McGonagall	109	" Well -- in that case ... "
56936	56957	56926	56927	Professor McGonagall	109	" Miss Granger , you foolish girl , how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own ? "
57006	57020	57022	57023	Professor McGonagall	109	" Miss Granger , five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this , "
57025	57059	57022	57023	Professor McGonagall	109	" I 'm very disappointed in you . If you 're not hurt at all , you 'd better get off to Gryffindor tower . Students are finishing the feast in their houses . "
57071	57116	57063	57064	Professor McGonagall	109	" Well , I still say you were lucky , but not many first years could have taken on a full - grown mountain troll . You each win Gryffindor five points . Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this . You may go . "
57157	57167	57168	57168	Ron	194	" We should have gotten more than ten points , "
57171	57185	57168	57168	Ron	194	" Five , you mean , once she 's taken off Hermione 's . "
57186	57199	57200	57200	Ron	194	" Good of her to get us out of trouble like that , "
57203	57212	57200	57200	Ron	194	" Mind you , we did save her . "
57213	57231	57232	57232	Harry	109	" She might not have needed saving if we had n't locked the thing in with her , "
57246	57250	57251	57251	they	1702	" Pig snout , "
57309	57312	57306	57306	they	1702	" Thanks , "
57842	57853	57828	57828	he	265	" What 's that you 've got there , Potter ? "
57865	57877	57879	57879	Snape	265	" Library books are not to be taken outside the school , "
57881	57892	57879	57879	Snape	265	" Give it to me . Five points from Gryffindor . "
57893	57902	57903	57903	Harry	95	" He 's just made that rule up , "
57911	57920	57903	57903	Harry	95	" Wonder what 's wrong with his leg ? "
57921	57933	57935	57935	Ron	194	" Dunno , but I hope it 's really hurting him , "
57980	57986	57973	57973	She	219	" How will you learn ? "
58055	58061	58062	58062	they	1726	" Better you than me , "
58169	58174	58175	58175	Snape	265	" Blasted thing * , "
58179	58195	58175	58175	Snape	265	" How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once ? "
58206	58209	58218	58218	he	265	" POTTER ! "
58231	58243	58228	58228	Harry	95	" I just wondered if I could have my book back . "
58244	58250	58218	58218	he	265	" GET OUT ! OUT ! "
58269	58275	58276	58276	Ron	194	" Did you get it ? "
58283	58289	58279	58279	Harry	95	" What 's the matter ? "
58303	58310	58311	58311	he	95	" You know what this means ? "
58315	58365	58311	58311	he	95	" He tried to get past that three - headed dog at Halloween ! That 's where he was going when we saw him -- he 's after whatever it 's guarding ! And I d bet my broomstick he let that troll in , to make a diversion ! "
58372	58382	58385	58385	he	95	" No -- he would n't , she said . "
58404	58404	58392	58392	he	95	"
58405	58419	58421	58421	Ron	194	" Honestly , Hermione , you think all teachers are saints or something , "
58423	58449	58421	58421	Ron	194	" I 'm with Harry . I would n't put anything past Snape . But what 's he after ? What 's that dog guarding ? "
58556	58565	58647	58647	Seamus	243	" You 've got to eat some breakfast . "
58566	58573	58647	58647	Seamus	243	" I do n't want anything . "
58574	58581	58583	58583	Hermione	219	" Just a bit of toast , "
58585	58591	58592	58592	Harry	95	" I 'm not hungry . "
58609	58617	58619	58620	Seamus Finnigan	243	" Harry , you need your strength , "
58622	58636	58619	58620	Seamus Finnigan	243	" Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team . "
58637	58642	58644	58644	Harry	95	" Thanks , Seamus , "
58817	58822	58823	58823	he	290	" Okay , men , "
58826	58830	58832	58834	Chaser Angelina Johnson	315	" And women , "
58836	58840	58841	58841	Wood	290	" And women , "
58844	58849	58841	58841	Wood	290	" This is it . "
58850	58855	58857	58858	Fred Weasley	192	" The big one , "
58860	58870	58872	58872	George	193	" The one we 've all been waiting for , "
58874	58883	58884	58884	Fred	192	" We know Oliver 's speech by heart , "
58888	58897	58884	58884	Fred	192	" we were on the team last year . "
58898	58905	58907	58907	Wood	290	" Shut up , you two , "
58909	58931	58907	58907	Wood	290	" This is the best team Gryffindor 's had in years . We 're going to win . I know it . "
58942	58946	58932	58932	He	290	" Or else . "
58947	58961	58932	58932	He	290	" Right . It 's time . Good luck , all of you . "
59017	59031	59032	59032	she	268	" Now , I want a nice fair game , all of you , "
59109	59116	59132	59132	her	268	" Mount your brooms , please . "
59152	59179	59148	59148	They	1751	" And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor -- what an excellent Chaser that girl is , and rather attractive , too -- "
59180	59183	59132	59132	her	268	" JORDAN ! "
59184	59189	59148	59148	They	1751	" Sorry , Professor . "
59213	59438	59132	59132	her	268	" And she 's really belting along up there , a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet , a good find of Oliver Wood 's , last year only a reserve -- back to Johnson and -- no , the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle , Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes -- Flint flying like an eagle up there -- he 's going to sc- no , stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle -- that 's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there , nice dive around Flint , off up the field and -- OUCH -- that must have hurt , hit in the back of the head by a Bludger -- Quaffle taken by the Slytherins -- that 's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts , but he 's blocked by a second Bludger -- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley , ca n't tell which -- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater , anyway , and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle , a clear field ahead and off she goes -- she 's really flying -- dodges a speeding Bludger -- the goal posts are ahead -- come on , now , Angelina -- Keeper Bletchley dives -- misses -- GRYFFINDORS SCORE ! "
59454	59462	59451	59452	the Slytherins	261	" Budge up there , move along . "
59463	59466	59467	59467	Ron	194	" Hagrid ! "
59481	59489	59491	59491	Hagrid	282	" Bin watchin ' from me hut , "
59503	59526	59491	59491	Hagrid	282	" But it is n't the same as bein ' in the crowd . No sign of the Snitch yet , eh ? "
59527	59530	59532	59532	Ron	194	" Nope , "
59534	59544	59532	59532	Ron	194	" Harry has n't had much to do yet . "
59545	59556	59558	59558	Hagrid	282	" Kept outta trouble , though , that 's somethin' , "
59605	59619	59620	59620	Wood	317	" Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch , "
59624	59637	59620	59620	Wood	317	" We do n't want you attacked before you have to be . "
59725	59732	59733	59733	he	192	" All right there , Harry ? "
59749	59754	59755	59756	Lee Jordan	198	" Slytherin in possession , "
59760	59788	59755	59756	Lee Jordan	198	" Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers , two Weasleys , and Chaser Bell , and speeds toward the -- wait a moment -- was that the Snitch ? "
59945	59948	59950	59951	the Gryffindors	260	" Foul ! "
60000	60010	59995	59996	Dean Thomas	166	" Send him off , ref ! Red card ! "
60011	60020	60022	60022	Ron	194	" What are you talking about , Dean ? "
60024	60028	60030	60030	Dean	166	" Red card ! "
60033	60050	60030	60030	Dean	166	" In soccer you get shown the red card and you 're out of the game ! "
60051	60060	60061	60061	Ron	194	" But this is n't soccer , Dean , "
60075	60090	60065	60065	Hagrid	282	" They oughta change the rules . Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air . "
60102	60112	60091	60092	Lee Jordan	198	" So -- after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating
60113	60116	60118	60119	Professor McGonagall	109	" Jordan ! "
60121	60130	60118	60119	Professor McGonagall	109	" I mean , after that open and revolting foul
60139	60139	60134	60134	I	0	"
60140	60192	60118	60119	Professor McGonagall	109	" All right , all right . Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker , which could happen to anyone , I 'm sure , so a penalty to Gryffindor , taken by Spinner , who puts it away , no trouble , and we continue play , Gryffindor still in possession . "
60365	60406	60360	60360	Lee	198	" Slytherin in possession -- Flint with the Quaffle -- passes Spinnet -- passes Bell -- hit hard in the face by a Bludger , hope it broke his nose -- only joking , Professor -- Slytherins score -- A no ...
60445	60454	60455	60455	Hagrid	282	" Dunno what Harry thinks he 's doing , "
60464	60489	60458	60458	He	282	" If I didn ' know better , I 'd say he 'd lost control of his broom ... but he ca n't have .... "
60556	60567	60568	60568	Seamus	243	" Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him ? "
60571	60576	60580	60580	his	282	" Ca n't have , "
60584	60608	60580	60580	his	282	" Ca n't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic -- no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand . "
60635	60641	60643	60643	Ron	194	" What are you doing ? "
60649	60654	60655	60655	Hermione	219	" I knew it , "
60658	60663	60655	60655	Hermione	219	" Snape -- look . "
60695	60705	60707	60707	Hermione	219	" He 's doing something -- jinxing the broom , "
60709	60715	60692	60692	his	265	" What should we do ? "
60716	60722	60692	60692	his	265	" Leave it to me . "
60840	60846	60847	60847	Ron	194	" Come on , Hermione , "
61005	61012	61013	61013	Ron	194	" Neville , you can look ! "
61074	61081	61082	61082	he	282	" I 've got the Snitch ! "
61099	61111	61112	61112	Flint	179	" He did n't catch it , he nearly swallowed it , "
61182	61187	61188	61188	Ron	194	" It was Snape , "
61192	61216	61188	61188	Ron	194	" Hermione and I saw him . He was cursing your broomstick , muttering , he would n't take his eyes off you . "
61217	61220	61222	61222	Hagrid	282	" Rubbish , "
61242	61251	61222	61222	Hagrid	282	" Why would Snape do somethin' like that ? "
61275	61283	61284	61284	he	282	" I found out something about him , "
61288	61318	61284	61284	he	282	" He tried to get past that three - headed dog on Halloween . It bit him . We think he was trying to steal whatever it 's guarding . "
61324	61332	61333	61333	he	282	" How do you know about Fluffy ? "
61336	61339	61269	61269	Harry	282	" Fluffy ? "
61340	61369	61417	61417	Hagrid	282	" Yeah -- he 's mine -- bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las ' year -- I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the
61370	61373	61375	61375	Harry	282	" Yes ? "
61378	61387	61389	61389	Hagrid	282	" Now , do n't ask me anymore , "
61392	61401	61389	61389	Hagrid	282	" That 's top secret , that is . "
61402	61411	61417	61417	Hagrid	282	" But Snape 's trying to steal it . "
61412	61415	61417	61417	Hagrid	282	" Rubbish , "
61420	61435	61417	61417	Hagrid	282	" Snape 's a Hogwarts teacher , he 'd do nothin' of the sort . "
61436	61447	61449	61449	Hermione	219	" So why did he just try and kill Harry ? "
61503	61503	61499	61499	I	0	"
61504	61514	61516	61516	Hagrid	282	" I 'm tellin ' yeh , yer wrong ! "
61519	61594	61516	61516	Hagrid	282	" I don ' know why Harry 's broom acted like that , but Snape wouldn ' try an ' kill a student ! Now , listen to me , all three of yeh -- yer meddlin ' in things that don ' concern yeh . It 's dangerous . You forget that dog , an ' you forget what it 's guardin ' , that 's between Professor Dumbledore an ' Nicolas Flamel -- "
61595	61598	61600	61600	Harry	282	" Aha ! "
61602	61615	61600	61600	Harry	282	" so there 's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved , is there ? "
61786	61793	61795	61796	Draco Malfoy	224	" I do feel so sorry , "
61802	61823	61795	61796	Draco Malfoy	224	" for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they 're not wanted at home . "
62076	62085	62086	62086	Ron	194	" Hi , Hagrid , want any help ? "
62096	62108	62090	62090	his	194	" Nah , I 'm all right , thanks , Ron . "
62109	62119	62121	62121	Malfoys	298	" Would you mind moving out of the way ? "
62128	62172	62121	62121	Malfoys	298	" Are you trying to earn some extra money , Weasley ? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts , I suppose -- that hut of Hagrid 's must seem like a palace compared to what your family 's used to . "
62185	62188	62179	62179	Snape	265	" WEASLEY ! "
62200	62208	62210	62210	Hagrid	282	" He was provoked , Professor Snape , "
62223	62231	62210	62210	Hagrid	282	" Malfoy was insultin ' his family . "
62232	62247	62249	62249	Snape	265	" Be that as it may , fighting is against Hogwarts rules , Hagrid , "
62252	62275	62249	62249	Snape	265	" Five points from Gryffindor , Weasley , and be grateful it is n't more . Move along , all of you . "
62294	62300	62302	62302	Ron	194	" I 'll get him , "
62312	62323	62302	62302	Ron	194	" one of these days , I 'll get him -- "
62324	62330	62332	62332	Harry	282	" I hate them both , "
62334	62339	62332	62332	Harry	282	" Malfoy and Snape . "
62340	62352	62354	62354	Hagrid	282	" Come on , cheer up , it 's nearly Christmas , "
62356	62375	62354	62354	Hagrid	282	" Tell yeh what , come with me an ' see the Great Hall , looks a treat . "
62405	62424	62479	62479	Hagrid	282	" Ah , Hagrid , the last tree -- put it in the far corner , would you ? "
62467	62478	62479	62479	Hagrid	282	" How many days you got left until yer holidays ? "
62482	62486	62488	62488	Hermione	219	" Just one , "
62490	62515	62488	62488	Hermione	219	" And that reminds me -Harry , Ron , we 've got half an hour before lunch , we should be in the library . "
62516	62524	62526	62526	Ron	194	" Oh yeah , you 're right , "
62557	62561	62563	62563	Hagrid	282	" The library ? "
62572	62585	62563	62563	Hagrid	282	" Just before the holidays ? Bit keen , are n't yeh ? "
62586	62594	62595	62595	Harry	282	" Oh , we 're not working , "
62600	62618	62595	62595	Harry	282	" Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we 've been trying to find out who he is . "
62619	62623	62624	62624	Hagrid	282	" You what ? "
62628	62652	62624	62624	Hagrid	282	" Listen here -- I 've told yeh -- drop it . It 's nothin' to you what that dog 's guardin ' . "
62653	62668	62670	62670	Hermione	219	" We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is , that 's all , "
62672	62686	62687	62687	Harry	282	" Unless you 'd like to tell us and save us the trouble ? "
62690	62723	62687	62687	Harry	282	" We must 've been through hundreds of books already and we ca n't find him anywhere -- just give us a hint -- I know I 've read his name somewhere . "
62724	62734	62753	62753	Hagrid	282	" I 'm sayin ' nothin , said Hagrid flatly .
62735	62746	62748	62748	Ron	194	" Just have to find out for ourselves , then , "
63009	63018	63028	63029	the librarian	1813	" What are you looking for , boy ? "
63019	63022	63024	63024	Harry	282	" Nothing , "
63037	63051	63028	63029	the librarian	1813	" You 'd better get out , then . Go on -- out ! "
63205	63219	63221	63221	Hermione	219	" You will keep looking while I 'm away , wo n't you ? "
63223	63234	63221	63221	Hermione	219	" And send me an owl if you find anything . "
63235	63249	63251	63251	Ron	194	" And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is , "
63253	63262	63251	63251	Ron	194	" It 'd be safe to ask them . "
63263	63273	63275	63275	Hermione	219	" Very safe , as they 're both dentists , "
63505	63529	63491	63491	they	1825	" Do n't send me there , ca n't you see his knight ? Send him , we can afford to lose him . "
63587	63591	63593	63593	Ron	194	" Merry Christmas , "
63607	63612	63614	63614	Harry	282	" You , too , "
63616	63629	63614	63614	Harry	282	" Will you look at this ? I 've got some presents ! "
63630	63638	63640	63640	Ron	194	" What did you expect , turnips ? "
63747	63752	63754	63754	Harry	282	" That 's friendly , "
63764	63767	63768	63768	he	194	" Weird ! "
63780	63780	63768	63768	he	194	"
63781	63787	63789	63789	Harry	282	" You can keep it , "
63798	63811	63789	63789	Harry	282	" Hagrid and my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these ? "
63812	63823	63825	63825	Ron	194	" I think I know who that one 's from , "
63839	63858	63859	63859	he	194	" My mom . I told her you did n't expect any presents and -- oh , no , "
63862	63871	63859	63859	he	194	" she 's made you a Weasley sweater . "
63898	63907	63909	63909	Ron	194	" Every year she makes us a sweater , "
63915	63922	63909	63909	Ron	194	" and mine 's always maroon . "
63923	63931	63933	63933	Harry	282	" That 's really nice of her , "
64003	64010	64011	64011	he	194	" I 've heard of those , "
64031	64050	64011	64011	he	194	" If that 's what I think it is -- they 're really rare , and really valuable . "
64051	64056	64011	64011	he	194	" What is it ? "
64081	64088	64090	64090	Ron	194	" It 's an invisibility cloak , "
64100	64111	64090	64090	Ron	194	" I 'm sure it is -- try it on . "
64125	64132	64120	64120	Ron	194	" It is ! Look down ! "
64186	64192	64194	64194	Ron	194	" There 's a note ! "
64197	64205	64194	64194	Ron	194	" A note fell out of it ! "
64280	64290	64291	64291	he	194	" I 'd give anything for one of these , "
64294	64302	64291	64291	he	194	" Anything . What 's the matter ? "
64303	64306	64308	64308	Harry	282	" Nothing , "
64374	64378	64396	64396	George	193	" Merry Christmas ! "
64379	64393	64394	64394	Fred	192	" Hey , look -- Harry 's got a Weasley sweater , too ! "
64415	64425	64427	64427	Fred	192	" Harry 's is better than ours , though , "
64435	64449	64427	64427	Fred	192	" She obviously makes more of an effort if you 're not family . "
64450	64460	64461	64461	George	193	" Why are n't you wearing yours , Ron ? "
64464	64478	64461	64461	George	193	" Come on , get it on , they 're lovely and warm . "
64479	64484	64485	64485	Ron	194	" I hate maroon , "
64496	64506	64507	64507	George	193	" You have n't got a letter on yours , "
64510	64537	64507	64507	George	193	" I suppose she thinks you do n't forget your name . But we 're not stupid -- we know we 're called Gred and Forge . "
64538	64545	64581	64581	Fred	192	" What 's all th is noise .
64584	64609	64581	64581	Fred	192	" P for prefect ! Get it on , Percy , come on , we 're all wearing ours , even Harry got one . "
64610	64635	64581	64581	Fred	192	" I -- do n't -- want said Percy thickly , as the twins forced the sweater over his head , knocking his glasses askew .
64636	64649	64651	64651	George	193	" And you 're not sitting with the prefects today , either , "
64653	64661	64651	64651	George	193	" Christmas is a time for family . "
65394	65399	65401	65403	the Fat Lady	299	" Who 's there ? "
65919	65949	65911	65911	he	109	" You asked me to come directly to you , Professor , if anyone was wandering around at night , and somebody 's been in the library Restricted Section . "
65991	66009	65987	65987	Snape	265	" The Restricted Section ? Well , they ca n't be far , we 'll catch them . "
66650	66653	66654	66654	he	109	" Mom ? "
66657	66660	66654	66654	he	109	" Dad ? "
66845	66851	66832	66832	He	109	" I 'll come back , "
66858	66866	66868	66868	Ron	194	" You could have woken me up , "
66872	66890	66832	66832	He	109	" You can come tonight , I 'm going back , I want to show you the mirror .
66891	66902	66903	66903	Ron	194	" I 'd like to see your mom and dad , "
66907	66934	66832	66832	He	109	" And I want to see all your family , all the Weasleys , you 'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone . "
66935	66944	66946	66946	Ron	194	" You can see them any old time , "
66948	66987	66946	66946	Ron	194	" Just come round my house this summer . Anyway , maybe it only shows dead people . Shame about not finding Flamel , though . Have some bacon or something , why are n't you eating anything ? "
67042	67048	67050	67050	Ron	194	" Are you all right ? "
67052	67057	67050	67050	Ron	194	" You look odd . "
67116	67121	67123	67123	Ron	194	" I 'm freezing , "
67125	67134	67123	67123	Ron	194	" Let 's forget it and go back . "
67135	67138	67139	67139	Harry	109	" No ! "
67149	67149	67139	67139	Harry	109	"
67190	67200	67201	67201	They	1891	" It 's here -- just here -- yes ! "
67236	67239	67240	67240	Harry	109	" See ? "
67243	67250	67240	67240	Harry	109	" I ca n't see anything . "
67251	67265	67228	67228	father	546	" Look ! Look at them all ... there are loads of them .... "
67266	67273	67240	67240	Harry	109	" I can only see you . "
67274	67288	67228	67228	father	546	" Look in it properly , go on , stand where I am . "
67328	67333	67334	67334	he	194	" Look at me ! "
67337	67348	67317	67317	Ron	194	" Can you see all your family standing around you ? "
67349	67371	67409	67409	Ron	194	" No -- I 'm alone -- but I 'm different -- I look older -- and I 'm head boy ! "
67372	67375	67317	67317	Ron	194	" What ? "
67376	67408	67409	67409	Ron	194	" I am -- I 'm wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I 'm holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup -- I 'm Quidditch captain , too .
67424	67434	67317	67317	Ron	194	" Do you think this mirror shows the future ? "
67435	67452	67317	67317	Ron	194	" How can it ? All my family are dead -- let me have another look -- "
67453	67470	67317	67317	Ron	194	" You had it to yourself all last night , give me a bit more time . "
67471	67493	67317	67317	Ron	194	" You 're only holding the Quidditch cup , what 's interesting about that ? I want to see my parents . "
67494	67500	67317	67317	Ron	194	" Do n't push me -- "
67526	67529	67521	67521	they	1900	" Quick ! "
67580	67602	67575	67575	she	274	" This is n't safe -- she might have gone for Filch , I bet she heard us . Come on . "
67622	67630	67632	67632	Ron	194	" Want to play chess , Harry ? "
67634	67637	67604	67604	Ron	194	" No . "
67638	67649	67604	67604	Ron	194	" Why do n't we go down and visit Hagrid ? "
67650	67656	67604	67604	Ron	194	" No ... you go ... "
67657	67677	67604	67604	Ron	194	" I know what you 're thinking about , Harry , that mirror . Do n't go back tonight . "
67678	67682	67604	67604	Ron	194	" Why not ? "
67683	67743	67604	67604	Ron	194	" I dunno , I 've just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway , you 've had too many close shaves already . Filch , Snape , and Mrs. Norris are wandering around . So what if they ca n't see you ? What if they walk into you ? What if you knock something over ? "
67744	67750	67604	67604	Ron	194	" You sound like Hermione . "
67751	67762	67604	67604	Ron	194	" I 'm serious , Harry , do n't go . "
67883	67891	67892	67892	Harry	282	" So -- back again , Harry ? "
67945	67955	67939	67939	he	282	" -- I did n't see you , sir . "
67956	67966	67968	67968	Dumbledore	108	" Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you , "
67981	67984	67986	67986	Dumbledore	108	" So , "
68000	68018	67986	67986	Dumbledore	108	" you , like hundreds before you , have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised . "
68019	68031	67939	67939	he	282	" I did n't know it was called that , Sir . "
68032	68045	67986	67986	Dumbledore	108	" But I expect you 've realized by now what it does ? "
68046	68057	67939	67939	he	282	" It -- well -- it shows me my family -- "
68058	68070	67986	67986	Dumbledore	108	" And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy . "
68071	68078	67939	67939	he	282	" How did you know -- ? "
68079	68090	68092	68092	Dumbledore	108	" I do n't need a cloak to become invisible , "
68095	68110	68092	68092	Dumbledore	108	" Now , can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all ? "
68116	68160	68113	68113	his	282	" Let me explain . The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror , that is , he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is . Does that help ? "
68169	68181	68165	68165	he	282	" It shows us what we want ... whatever we want ... "
68182	68187	68189	68189	Dumbledore	108	" Yes and no , "
68192	68292	68189	68189	Dumbledore	108	" It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest , most desperate desire of our hearts . You , who have never known your family , see them standing around you . Ronald Weasley , who has always been overshadowed by his brothers , sees himself standing alone , the best of all of them . However , this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth . Men have wasted away before it , entranced by what they have seen , or been driven mad , not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible .
68293	68367	68368	68368	Harry	282	" The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow , Harry , and I ask you not to go looking for it again . If you ever do run across it , you will now be prepared . It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live , remember that . Now , why do n't you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed ? "
68372	68384	68368	68368	Harry	282	" Sir -- Professor Dumbledore ? Can I ask you something ? "
68385	68394	68395	68395	Dumbledore	118	" Obviously , you 've just done so , "
68398	68409	68395	68395	Dumbledore	118	" You may ask me one more thing , however . "
68410	68422	68368	68368	Harry	282	" What do you see when you look in the mirror ? "
68423	68438	68395	68395	Dumbledore	118	" I ? I see myself holding a pair of thick , woolen socks . "
68442	68450	68452	68452	Dumbledore	118	" One can never have enough socks , "
68454	68478	68452	68452	Dumbledore	118	" Another Christmas has come and gone and I did n't get a single pair . People will insist on giving me books . "
68612	68627	68629	68629	Ron	194	" You see , Dumbledore was right , that mirror could drive you mad , "
68681	68688	68657	68657	She	219	" If Filch had caught you ! "
68907	68914	68915	68915	he	317	" Will you stop messing around ! "
68918	68953	68915	68915	he	317	" That 's exactly the sort of thing that 'll lose us the match ! Snape 's refereeing this time , and he 'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor ! "
68966	68971	68972	68972	he	193	" Snape 's refereeing ? "
68980	69003	68972	68972	he	193	" When 's he ever refereed a Quidditch match ? He 's not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin . "
69018	69025	69027	69027	Wood	317	" It 's not my fault , "
69029	69055	69027	69027	Wood	317	" We 've just got to make sure we play a clean game , so Snape has n't got an excuse to pick on us . "
69143	69153	69155	69155	Ron	194	" Do n't talk to me for a moment , "
69164	69170	69171	69171	He	194	" I need to concen -- "
69179	69191	69175	69175	Harry	282	" What 's the matter with you ? You look terrible . "
69220	69225	69227	69227	Hermione	219	" Do n't play , "
69231	69237	69239	69239	Ron	194	" Say you 're ill , "
69241	69248	69249	69249	Hermione	219	" Pretend to break your leg , "
69252	69258	69260	69260	Ron	194	" Really break your leg , "
69262	69267	69269	69269	Harry	282	" I ca n't , "
69271	69291	69269	69269	Harry	282	" There is n't a reserve Seeker . If I back out , Gryffindor ca n't play at all . "
69381	69385	69388	69388	him	197	" What happened ? "
69400	69403	69405	69405	Neville	197	" Malfoy , "
69408	69429	69405	69405	Neville	197	" I met him outside the library . He said he 'd been looking for someone to practice that on . "
69430	69436	69439	69439	Neville	197	" Go to Professor McGonagall ! "
69441	69445	69439	69439	Neville	197	" Report him ! "
69451	69459	69460	69460	he	197	" I do n't want more trouble , "
69463	69475	69477	69477	Ron	194	" You 've got to stand up to him , Neville ! "
69479	69506	69477	69477	Ron	194	" He 's used to walking all over people , but that 's no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier . "
69507	69531	69532	69532	Neville	197	" There 's no need to tell me I 'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor , Malfoy 's already done that , "
69579	69587	69588	69588	Harry	109	" You 're worth twelve of Malfoy , "
69591	69613	69588	69588	Harry	109	" The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor , did n't it ? And where 's Malfoy ? In stinking Slytherin . "
69628	69654	69623	69623	he	197	" Thanks , Harry ... I think I 'll go to bed .... D'you want the card , you collect them , do n't you ? "
69668	69672	69673	69673	he	109	" Dumbledore again , "
69676	69684	69673	69673	he	109	" He was the first one I ever- "
69706	69712	69713	69713	he	109	" I 've found him ! "
69716	69787	69713	69713	he	109	" I 've found Flamel ! I told you I 'd read the name somewhere before , I read it on the train coming here -- listen to this : ' Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945 , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon 's blood , and his work on alchemy with his partner , Nicolas Flamel ' ! "
69815	69819	69820	69820	she	219	" Stay there ! "
69859	69868	69869	69869	she	219	" I never thought to look in here ! "
69873	69890	69869	69869	she	219	" I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading . "
69891	69894	69896	69896	Ron	194	" Light ? "
69934	69943	69899	69899	Hermione	219	" I knew it ! I knew it ! "
69944	69952	69954	69954	Ron	194	" Are we allowed to speak yet ? "
69961	69965	69966	69966	she	219	" Nicolas Flamel , "
69970	69982	69966	69966	she	219	" is the only known maker of the Sorcerer 's Stone ! "
69994	69998	70000	70000	Harry	109	" The what ? "
70004	70022	70023	70023	She	219	" Oh , honestly , do n't you two read ? Look -- read that , there . "
70152	70155	70157	70157	Hermione	219	" See ? "
70166	70214	70162	70162	Ron	194	" The dog must be guarding Flamel 's Sorcerer 's Stone ! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him , because they 're friends and he knew someone was after it , that 's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts ! "
70215	70228	70230	70230	Harry	109	" A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying ! "
70232	70245	70230	70230	Harry	109	" No wonder Snape 's after it ! Anyone would want it . "
70246	70264	70266	70266	Ron	194	" And no wonder we could n't find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry , "
70268	70287	70266	70266	Ron	194	" He 's not exactly recent if he 's six hundred and sixty - five , is he ? "
70351	70358	70359	70359	he	109	" I 'm going to play , "
70365	70403	70359	70359	he	109	" If I do n't , all the Slytherins will think I 'm just too scared to face Snape . I 'll show them ... it 'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win . "
70404	70418	70420	70420	Hermione	219	" Just as long as we 're not wiping you off the field , "
70743	70755	70756	70756	Hermione	219	" Now , do n't forget , it 's Locomotor Mortis , "
70767	70771	70772	70772	Ron	194	" I know , "
70775	70780	70772	70772	Ron	194	" Do n't nag . "
70793	70829	70787	70787	Wood	317	" Do n't want to pressure you , Potter , but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it 's now . Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much . "
70830	70838	70840	70841	Fred Weasley	192	" The whole school 's out there ! "
70849	70860	70840	70841	Fred Weasley	192	" Even -- blimey -- Dumbledore 's come to watch ! "
70868	70871	70872	70872	he	95	" Dumbledore ? "
70950	70960	70961	70961	he	194	" I 've never seen Snape look so mean , "
70965	70971	70961	70961	he	194	" Look -they're off Ouch ! "
70987	71000	70985	70985	Malfoy	224	" Oh , sorry , Weasley , did n't see you there . "
71009	71035	71001	71001	Malfoy	224	" Wonder how long Potter 's going to stay on his broom this time ? Anyone want a bet ? What about you , Weasley ? "
71090	71104	71106	71106	Malfoy	224	" You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team ? "
71125	71173	71116	71116	Hufflepuff	32	" It 's people they feel sorry for . See , there 's Potter , who 's got no parents , then there 's the Weasleys , who 've got no money -- you should be on the team , Longbottom , you 've got no brains . "
71187	71197	71198	71198	he	197	" I 'm worth twelve of you , Malfoy , "
71227	71234	71212	71212	Ron	194	" You tell him , Neville . "
71235	71255	71201	71201	Malfoy	224	" Longbottom , if brains were gold you 'd be poorer than Weasley , and that 's saying something . "
71271	71281	71212	71212	Ron	194	" I 'm warning you , Malfoy -- one more word
71282	71285	71287	71287	Hermione	219	" Ron ! "
71290	71293	71287	71287	Hermione	219	" Harry -- "
71294	71299	71212	71212	Ron	194	" What ? Where ? "
71339	71357	71359	71359	Malfoy	224	" You 're in luck , Weasley , Potter 's obviously spotted some money on the ground ! "
71398	71404	71405	71405	Hermione	219	" Come on , Harry ! "
71529	71557	71559	71559	Hermione	219	" Ron ! Ron ! Where are you ? The game 's over ! Harry 's won ! We 've won ! Gryffindor is in the lead ! "
71652	71656	71658	71658	Dumbledore	211	" Well done , "
71668	71687	71658	71658	Dumbledore	211	" Nice to see you have n't been brooding about that mirror ... been keeping busy ... excellent ... "
72071	72095	72067	72067	they	1969	" ... d - don't know why you wanted t - t - to meet here of all p - places , Severus ... "
72096	72107	72109	72109	Snape	265	" Oh , I thought we 'd keep this private , "
72115	72131	72111	72111	his	265	" Students are n't supposed to know about the Sorcerer 's Stone , after all . "
72145	72161	72141	72141	Snape	265	" Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid 's yet ? "
72162	72172	72111	72111	his	265	" B - b - but Severus , I -- "
72173	72185	72187	72187	Snape	265	" You do n't want me as your enemy , Quirrell , "
72195	72203	72187	72187	Snape	265	" I - I do n't know what you
72204	72213	72111	72111	his	265	" You know perfectly well what I mean . "
72238	72252	72235	72235	Snape	265	" -- your little bit of hocus - pocus . I 'm waiting . "
72253	72264	72235	72235	Snape	265	" B - but I d - d - don't -- "
72265	72269	72270	72270	Snape	265	" Very well , "
72274	72299	72270	72270	Snape	265	" We 'll have another little chat soon , when you 've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie . "
72335	72343	72344	72344	Hermione	219	" Harry , where have you been ? "
72347	72357	72359	72359	Ron	194	" We won ! You won ! We won ! "
72367	72437	72359	72359	Ron	194	" And I gave Malfoy a black eye , and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single - handed ! He 's still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he 'll be all right - talk about showing Slytherin ! Everyone 's waiting for you in the common room , we 're having a party , Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens . "
72438	72444	72446	72446	Harry	282	" Never mind that now , "
72449	72465	72446	72446	Harry	282	" Let 's find an empty room , you wait ' til you hear this .... "
72491	72575	72481	72481	he	282	" So we were right , it is the Sorcerer 's Stone , and Snape 's trying to force Quirrell to help him get it . He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy - and he said something about Quirrell 's ' hocus pocuss-- I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy , loads of enchantments , probably , and Quirrell would have done some anti - Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through -- "
72576	72594	72596	72596	Hermione	219	" So you mean the Stone 's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape ? "
72600	72609	72611	72611	Ron	194	" It 'll be gone by next Tuesday , "
72786	72795	72777	72777	she	219	" Hermione , the exams are ages away . "
72796	72800	72801	72801	Hermione	219	" Ten weeks , "
72804	72819	72801	72801	Hermione	219	" That 's not ages , that 's like a second to Nicolas Flamel . "
72820	72830	72831	72831	Ron	194	" But we 're not six hundred years old , "
72835	72849	72831	72831	Ron	194	" Anyway , what are you studying for , you already know it A. "
72850	72900	72801	72801	Hermione	219	" What am I studying for ? Are you crazy ? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year ? They 're very important , I should have started studying a month ago , I do n't know what 's gotten into me .... "
72989	72996	72997	72997	Ron	194	" I 'll never remember this , "
73060	73062	73122	73122	he	282	" Dittany "
73081	73092	73078	73078	Ron	194	" Hagrid ! What are you doing in the library ? "
73115	73121	73122	73122	he	282	" Jus ' lookin ' , "
73136	73146	73122	73122	he	282	" An ' what 're you lot up ter ? "
73152	73165	73147	73147	He	282	" Yer not still lookin ' fer Nicolas Flamel , are yeh ? "
73166	73178	73180	73180	Ron	194	" Oh , we found out who he is ages ago , "
73183	73200	73180	73180	Ron	194	" And we know what that dog 's guarding , it 's a Sorcerer 's St -- "
73201	73204	73205	73205	Hagrid	282	" Shhhh ! "
73216	73232	73205	73205	Hagrid	282	" Don ' go shoutin ' about it , what 's the matter with yeh ? "
73233	73251	73253	73253	Harry	282	" There are a few things we wanted to ask you , as a matter of fact , "
73255	73266	73253	73253	Harry	282	" about what 's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy -- "
73267	73270	73272	73272	Hagrid	282	" SHHHH ! "
73275	73325	73272	73272	Hagrid	282	" Listen - come an ' see me later , I 'm not promisin ' I 'll tell yeh anythin ' , mind , but don ' go rabbitin ' about it in here , students aren ' s'pposed ter know . They 'll think I 've told yeh -- "
73326	73333	73335	73335	Harry	282	" See you later , then , "
73341	73350	73352	73352	Hermione	219	" What was he hiding behind his back ? "
73355	73368	73352	73352	Hermione	219	" Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone ? "
73369	73381	73383	73383	Ron	194	" I 'm going to see what section he was in , "
73414	73417	73418	73418	he	194	" Dragons ! "
73421	73453	73418	73418	he	194	" Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons ! Look at these : Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland ; From Egg to Inferno , A Dragon Keeper 's Guide . "
73454	73474	73476	73476	Harry	282	" Hagrid 's always wanted a dragon , he told me so the first time I ever met him , "
73478	73486	73488	73488	Ron	194	" But it 's against our laws , "
73490	73552	73488	73488	Ron	194	" Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks ' Convention of 1709 , everyone knows that . It 's hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we 're keeping dragons in the back garden - anyway , you ca n't tame dragons , it 's dangerous . You should see the burns Charlie 's got off wild ones in Romania . "
73553	73563	73565	73565	Harry	282	" But there are n't wild dragons in Britain ? "
73567	73573	73575	73575	Ron	194	" Of course there are , "
73577	73620	73575	73575	Ron	194	" Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks . The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up , I can tell you . Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who 've spotted them , to make them forget . "
73621	73630	73632	73632	Hermione	219	" So what on earths Hagrid up to ? "
73663	73668	73670	73670	he	282	" Who is it ? "
73722	73732	73708	73708	Hagrid	282	" So -- yeh wanted to ask me somethin' ? "
73733	73736	73738	73738	Harry	282	" Yes , "
73749	73769	73738	73738	Harry	282	" We were wondering if you could tell us what 's guarding the Sorcerer 's Stone apart from Fluffy . "
73775	73786	73770	73770	Hagrid	282	" 0 ' course I ca nt , he said . "
73851	73851	73849	73849	Fluffy	327	"
73852	73882	73884	73884	Hermione	219	" Oh , come on , Hagrid , you might not want to tell us , but you do know , you know everything that goes on round here , "
73904	73916	73900	73900	he	282	" We only wondered who had done the guarding , really . "
73921	73937	73900	73900	he	282	" We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him , apart from you . "
73954	73997	73998	73998	he	282	" Well , I don ' s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that ... let 's see ... he borrowed Fluffy from me ... then some o ' the teachers did enchantments ... Professor Sprout -- Professor Flitwick -- Professor McGonagall -- "
74006	74035	73998	73998	he	282	" Professor Quirrell -- an ' Dumbledore himself did somethin' , o ' course . Hang on , I 've forgotten someone . Oh yeah , Professor Snape . "
74036	74039	73998	73998	he	282	" Snape ? "
74040	74070	73998	73998	he	282	" Yeah -- yer not still on abou ' that , are yeh ? Look , Snape helped protect the Stone , he 's not about ter steal it . "
74130	74150	74152	74152	Harry	282	" You 're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy . are n't you , Hagrid ? "
74155	74173	74152	74152	Harry	282	" And you would n't tell anyone , would you ? Not even one of the teachers ? "
74174	74185	74187	74187	Hagrid	282	" Not a soul knows except me an ' Dumbledore , "
74190	74197	74198	74198	Harry	282	" Well , that 's something , "
74204	74218	74198	74198	Harry	282	" Hagrid , can we have a window open ? I 'm boiling . "
74219	74227	74229	74229	Hagrid	282	" Ca n't , Harry , sorry , "
74246	74253	74239	74239	Harry	282	" Hagrid -- what 's that ? "
74281	74284	74286	74286	Hagrid	282	" Ah , "
74294	74299	74286	74286	Hagrid	282	" That 's er ... "
74300	74309	74311	74311	Ron	194	" Where did you get it , Hagrid ? "
74326	74335	74311	74311	Ron	194	" It must 've cost you a fortune . "
74336	74340	74342	74342	Hagrid	282	" Won it , "
74344	74387	74342	74342	Hagrid	282	" Las ' night . I was down in the village havin' a few drinks an ' got into a game o ' cards with a stranger . Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it , ter be honest . "
74388	74403	74405	74405	Hermione	219	" But what are you going to do with it when it 's hatched ? "
74407	74430	74311	74311	Ron	194	" Well , I 've bin doin' some readin ' , said Hagrid , pulling a large book from under his pillow . "
74527	74527	74525	74525	them	1994	"
74540	74550	74551	74551	she	219	" Hagrid , you live in a wooden house , "
74599	74611	74612	74612	Ron	194	" Wonder what it 's like to have a peaceful life , "
74695	74713	74688	74688	Hermione	219	" Hermione , how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching ? "
74714	74747	74688	74688	Hermione	219	" We 've got lessons , we 'll get into trouble , and that 's nothing to what Hagrid 's going to be in when someone finds out what he 's doing -- "
74748	74752	74753	74753	Harry	282	" Shut up ! "
74864	74870	74871	74871	He	282	" It 's nearly out . "
75003	75009	75010	75010	Hagrid	282	" Is n't he beautiful ? "
75035	75046	75048	75048	Hagrid	282	" Bless him , look , he knows his mommy ! "
75050	75053	75055	75055	Hermione	219	" Hagrid , "
75057	75067	75055	75055	Hermione	219	" how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow , exactly ? "
75093	75099	75082	75082	he	282	" What 's the matter ? "
75100	75127	75082	75082	he	282	" Someone was lookin ' through the gap in the curtains -- it 's a kid -- he 's runnin ' back up ter the school . "
75195	75201	75202	75202	Harry	282	" Just let him go , "
75205	75210	75202	75202	Harry	282	" Set him free . "
75211	75216	75218	75218	Hagrid	282	" I ca n't , "
75220	75230	75218	75218	Hagrid	282	" He 's too little . He 'd die . "
75287	75296	75298	75298	Hagrid	282	" I 've decided to call him Norbert , "
75308	75325	75298	75298	Hagrid	282	" He really knows me now , watch . Norbert ! Norbert ! Where 's Mommy ? "
75326	75333	75334	75334	Ron	194	" He 's lost his marbles , "
75341	75344	75346	75346	Harry	282	" Hagrid , "
75349	75375	75346	75346	Harry	282	" give it two weeks and Norbert 's going to be as long as your house . Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment . "
75381	75406	75376	75376	Hagrid	282	" I -- I know I ca n't keep him forever , but I ca n't jus ' dump him , I ca n't . "
75418	75426	75428	75428	Ron	194	" You 're losing it , too , "
75430	75437	75428	75428	Ron	194	" I 'm Ron , remember ? "
75438	75476	75415	75415	he	282	" No -- Charlie -- your brother , Charlie . In Romania . Studying dragons . We could send Norbert to him . Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild ! "
75477	75480	75482	75482	Ron	194	" Brilliant ! "
75484	75491	75482	75482	Ron	194	" How about it , Hagrid ? "
75593	75598	75599	75599	he	194	" It bit me ! "
75615	75691	75599	75599	he	194	" I 'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week . I tell you , that dragon 's the most horrible animal I 've ever met , but the way Hagrid goes on about it , you 'd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit . When it bit me he told me off for frightening it . And when I left , he was singing it a lullaby . "
75701	75706	75708	75708	Harry	282	" It 's Hedwig ! "
75716	75724	75708	75708	Harry	282	" She 'll have Charlie 's answer ! "
75855	75863	75865	75865	Harry	282	" We 've got the invisibility cloak , "
75867	75889	75865	75865	Harry	282	" It should n't be too difficult -- I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert . "
76019	76027	76028	76028	he	194	" It 's not just my hand , "
76031	76114	76028	76028	he	194	" although that feels like it 's about to fall off . Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me . He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me -- I 've told her it was a dog , but I do n't think she believes me -I should n't have hit him at the Quidditch match , that 's why he 's doing this . "
76124	76135	76137	76137	Hermione	219	" It 'll all be over at midnight on Saturday , "
76162	76167	76168	76168	he	194	" Midnight on Saturday ! "
76175	76208	76168	76168	he	194	" Oh no oh no -- I 've just remembered -- Charlie 's letter was in that book Malfoy took , he 's going to know we 're getting rid of Norbert . "
76237	76248	76249	76249	Harry	282	" It 's too late to change the plan now , "
76253	76300	76249	76249	Harry	282	" We have n't got time to send Charlie another owl , and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert . We 'll have to risk it . And we have got the invisibility cloak , Malfoy does n't know about that . "
76330	76338	76339	76339	he	282	" I wo n't let you in , "
76342	76356	76339	76339	he	282	" Norbert 's at a tricky stage -- nothin' I ca n't handle . "
76387	76415	76378	76378	Norbert	338	" Aargh ! It 's all right , he only got my boot -- jus ' playin ' -- he 's only a baby , after all . "
76540	76556	76558	76558	Hagrid	282	" He 's got lots o ' rats an ' some brandy fer the journey , "
76564	76579	76558	76558	Hagrid	282	" An ' I 've packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely . "
76602	76609	76610	76610	Hagrid	282	" Bye - bye , Norbert ! "
76630	76637	76628	76628	themselves	2025	" Mommy will never forget you ! "
76697	76701	76702	76702	Harry	282	" Nearly there ! "
76779	76782	76783	76783	she	2036	" Detention ! "
76786	76806	76783	76783	she	2036	" And twenty points from Slytherin ! Wandering around in the middle of the night , how dare you -- "
76807	76826	76761	76762	Professor McGonagall	109	" You do n't understand , Professor . Harry Potter 's coming -- he 's got a dragon ! "
76827	76852	76783	76783	she	2036	" What utter rubbish ! How dare you tell such lies ! Come on -- I shall see Professor Snape about you , Malfoy ! "
76908	76918	76901	76901	Hermione	219	" Malfoy 's got detention ! I could sing ! "
76919	76923	76924	76924	Harry	95	" Do n't , "
77087	77094	77095	77095	he	338	" Well , well , well , "
77098	77104	77095	77095	he	338	" we are in trouble . "
77308	77311	77312	77312	Neville	197	" Harry ! "
77324	77353	77312	77312	Neville	197	" I was trying to find you to warn you , I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you , he said you had a drag -- "
77388	77422	77380	77380	she	219	" I would never have believed it of any of you . Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower . It 's one o'clock in the morning . Explain yourselves . "
77452	77468	77470	77471	Professor McGonagall	109	" I think I 've got a good idea of what 's been going on , "
77473	77536	77470	77471	Professor McGonagall	109	" It does n't take a genius to work it out . You fed Draco Malfoy some cock - and - bull story about a dragon , trying to get him out of bed and into trouble . I 've already caught him . I suppose you think it 's funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it , too ? "
77589	77594	77596	77597	Professor McGonagall	109	" I 'm disgusted , "
77599	77694	77596	77597	Professor McGonagall	109	" Four students out of bed in one night ! I 've never heard of such a thing before ! You , Miss Granger , I thought you had more sense . As for you , Mr. Potter , I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this . All three of you will receive detentions -- yes , you too , Mr. Longbottom , nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night , especially these days , it 's very dangerous -- and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor . "
77695	77698	77699	77699	Harry	95	" Fifty ? "
77719	77724	77732	77732	her	2059	" Fifty points each , "
77738	77741	77732	77732	her	2059	" Professor -- please
77742	77747	77596	77597	Professor McGonagall	109	" You ca n't -- "
77748	77783	77732	77732	her	2059	" Do n't tell me what I can and ca n't do , Potter . Now get back to bed , all of you . I 've never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students . "
78054	78063	78045	78045	he	261	" Thanks Potter , we owe you one ! "
78070	78104	78032	78032	they	2346	" They 'll all forget this in a few weeks . Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they 've been here , and people still like them . "
78105	78124	78126	78126	Harry	95	" They 've never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go , though , have they ? "
78129	78134	78135	78135	Ron	194	" Well -- no , "
78197	78200	78201	78201	Wood	317	" Resign ? "
78204	78227	78201	78201	Wood	317	" What good'll that do ? How are we going to get any points back if we ca n't win at Quidditch ? "
78261	78265	78258	78258	they	1741	" the Seeker . "
78456	78466	78452	78452	Quirrell	338	" No -- no -- not again , please -- "
78480	78487	78490	78490	Quirrell	338	" All right -- all right -- "
78654	78662	78664	78664	Ron	194	" Snape 's done it , then ! "
78666	78682	78664	78664	Ron	194	" If Quirrell 's told him how to break his Anti - Dark Force spell -- "
78683	78691	78693	78693	Hermione	219	" There 's still Fluffy , though , "
78695	78710	78712	78712	Ron	194	" Maybe Snape 's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid , "
78724	78755	78712	78712	Ron	194	" I bet there 's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three - headed dog . So what do we do , Harry ? "
78775	78803	78769	78769	Hermione	219	" Go to Dumbledore . That 's what we should have done ages ago . If we try anything ourselves we 'll be thrown out for sure . "
78804	78812	78814	78814	Harry	282	" But we 've got no proof ! "
78816	78945	78814	78814	Harry	282	" Quirrell 's too scared to back us up . Snape 's only got to say he does n't know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor -- who do you think they 'll believe , him or us ? It 's not exactly a secret we hate him , Dumbledore'll think we made it up to get him sacked . Filch would n't help us if his life depended on it , he 's too friendly with Snape , and the more students get thrown out , the better , he 'll think . And do n't forget , we 're not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy . That 'll take a lot of explaining . "
78955	78966	79012	79012	Hermione	219	" If we just do a bit of poking around -- "
78967	78970	78972	78972	Harry	282	" No , "
78975	78983	78972	78972	Harry	282	" we 've done enough poking around . "
79152	79156	79158	79158	Filch	267	" Follow me , "
79187	79195	79168	79168	I	0	" he said , leering at them . "
79285	79285	79286	79286	They	2084	"
79360	79376	79408	79408	Filch	267	" Is that you , Filch ? Hurry up , I want ter get started . "
79411	79455	79408	79408	Filch	267	" I suppose you think you 'll be enjoying yourself with that oaf ? Well , think again , boy -- it 's into the forest you 're going and I 'm much mistaken if you 'll all come out in one piece . "
79474	79478	79479	79479	he	224	" The forest ? "
79493	79517	79483	79483	he	224	" We ca n't go in there at night -- there 's all sorts of things in there -- werewolves , I heard . "
79532	79542	79544	79544	Filch	267	" That 's your problem , is n't it ? "
79552	79569	79546	79546	his	267	" Should 've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble , should n't you ? "
79602	79607	79608	79608	he	282	" Abou ' time , "
79611	79629	79608	79608	he	282	" I bin waitin ' fer half an hour already . All right , Harry , Hermione ? "
79630	79642	79644	79644	Filch	267	" I should n't be too friendly to them , Hagrid , "
79657	79657	79644	79644	Filch	267	"
79658	79668	79670	79670	Hagrid	282	" That 's why yer late , is it ? "
79676	79704	79670	79670	Hagrid	282	" Bin lecturin ' them , eh ? ' Snot your place ter do that . Yeh've done yer bit , I 'll take over from here . "
79705	79713	79715	79715	Filch	267	" I 'll be back at dawn , "
79717	79725	79726	79726	he	267	" for what 's left of them , "
79754	79779	79670	79670	Hagrid	282	" I 'm not going in that forest , he said , and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice .
79780	79791	79793	79793	Hagrid	282	" Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts , "
79796	79810	79793	79793	Hagrid	282	" Yeh've done wrong an ' now yehve got ter pay fer it . "
79811	79846	79670	79670	Hagrid	282	" But this is servant stuff , it 's not for students to do . I thought we 'd be copying lines or something , if my father knew I was doing this , he 'd
79857	79861	79793	79793	Hagrid	282	" Hagrid growled . "
79905	79906	79912	79912	He	224	" '
79924	79928	79930	79930	Hagrid	282	" Right then , "
79932	79969	79930	79930	Hagrid	282	" now , listen carefully , 'cause it 's dangerous what we 're gon na do tonight , an ' I don ' want no one takin ' risks . Follow me over here a moment . "
80017	80021	80023	80023	Hagrid	282	" Look there , "
80025	80094	80023	80023	Hagrid	282	" see that stuff shinin ' on the ground ? Silvery stuff ? That 's unicorn blood . There 's a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat . This is the second time in a week . I found one dead last Wednesday . We 're gon na try an ' find the poor thing . We might have ter put it out of its misery . "
80095	80107	80109	80109	Malfoy	224	" And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first ? "
80121	80141	80143	80143	Hagrid	282	" There 's nothin' that lives in the forest that 'll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang , "
80145	80195	80143	80143	Hagrid	282	" An ' keep ter the path . Right , now , we 're gon na split inter two parties an ' follow the trail in diff'rent directions . There 's blood all over the place , it must 've bin staggerin ' around since last night at least . "
80196	80201	80203	80203	Malfoy	224	" I want Fang , "
80213	80227	80229	80229	Hagrid	282	" All right , but I warn yeh , he 's a coward , "
80231	80321	80229	80229	Hagrid	282	" So me , Harry , an ' Hermione'll go one way an ' Draco , Neville , an ' Fang'll go the other . Now , if any of us finds the unicorn , we 'll send up green sparks , right ? Get yer wands out an ' practice now -- that 's it -- an ' if anyone gets in trouble , send up red sparks , an ' we 'll all come an ' find yeh -- so , be careful -- let 's go . "
80409	80418	80419	80419	Harry	282	" Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns ? "
80422	80427	80429	80429	Hagrid	282	" Not fast enough , "
80431	80456	80429	80429	Hagrid	282	" It 's not easy ter catch a unicorn , they 're powerful magic creatures . I never knew one ter be hurt before . "
80495	80502	80503	80503	Hagrid	282	" You all right , Hermione ? "
80506	80538	80503	80503	Hagrid	282	" Don ' worry , it ca n't 've gone far if it 's this badly hurt , an ' then we 'll be able ter -- GET BEHIND THAT TREE ! "
80617	80622	80623	80623	he	282	" I knew it , "
80626	80637	80623	80623	he	282	" There 's summat in here that shouldn ' be . "
80638	80642	80643	80643	Harry	282	" A werewolf ? "
80646	80662	80664	80664	Hagrid	282	" That wasn ' no werewolf an ' it wasn ' no unicorn , neither , "
80667	80678	80664	80664	Hagrid	282	" Right , follow me , but careful , now . "
80702	80707	80708	80708	Hagrid	282	" Who 's there ? "
80711	80719	80708	80708	Hagrid	282	" Show yerself -- I 'm armed ! "
80772	80781	80783	80783	Hagrid	282	" Oh , it 's you , Ronan , "
80787	80792	80783	80783	Hagrid	282	" How are yeh ? "
80803	80811	80813	80813	Ronan	350	" Good evening to you , Hagrid , "
80823	80831	80815	80815	He	350	" Were you going to shoot me ? "
80832	80841	80843	80843	Hagrid	282	" Ca n't be too careful , Ronan , "
80849	80893	80843	80843	Hagrid	282	" There 's summat bad loose in this forest . This is Harry Potter an ' Hermione Granger , by the way . Students up at the school . An ' this is Ronan , you two . He 's a centaur . ) )
80894	80899	80901	80901	Hermione	219	" We 'd noticed , "
80904	80908	80910	80910	Ronan	350	" Good evening , "
80912	80929	80910	80910	Ronan	350	" Students , are you ? And do you learn much , up at the school ? "
80930	80933	80843	80843	Hagrid	282	" Erm -- "
80934	80938	80940	80940	Hermione	219	" A bit , "
80943	80953	80954	80954	Ronan	350	" A bit . Well , that 's something . "
80968	80974	80957	80957	He	350	" Mars is bright tonight . "
80975	80978	80980	80980	Hagrid	282	" Yeah , "
80987	81014	80980	80980	Hagrid	282	" Listen , I 'm glad we 've run inter yeh , Ronan , 'cause there 's a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen anythin ' ? "
81030	81039	81040	81040	he	350	" Always the innocent are the first victims , "
81043	81057	81040	81040	he	350	" So it has been for ages past , so it is now . "
81058	81061	81063	81063	Hagrid	282	" Yeah , "
81065	81079	81063	81063	Hagrid	282	" but have yeh seen anythin ' , Ronan ? Anythin ' unusual ? "
81080	81086	81087	81087	Ronan	350	" Mars is bright tonight , "
81096	81100	81091	81091	Hagrid	282	" Unusually bright . "
81101	81120	81063	81063	Hagrid	282	" Yeah , but I was meanin ' anythin ' unusual a bit nearer home , said Hagrid . "
81130	81130	81091	81091	Hagrid	282	"
81147	81154	81144	81144	he	350	" The forest hides many secrets . "
81189	81194	81196	81196	Hagrid	282	" Hullo , Bane , "
81198	81202	81196	81196	Hagrid	282	" All right ? "
81203	81215	81161	81161	Ronan	350	" Good evening , Hagrid , I hope you are well ? "
81216	81255	81196	81196	Hagrid	282	" Well enough . Look , I 've jus ' bin askin ' Ronan , you seen anythin ' odd in here lately ? There 's a unicorn bin injured -- would yeh know anythin ' about it ? "
81269	81275	81276	81276	he	352	" Mars is bright tonight , "
81280	81285	81287	81287	Hagrid	282	" We 've heard , "
81290	81317	81287	81287	Hagrid	282	" Well , if either of you do see anythin ' , let me know , wo n't yeh ? We 'll be off , then . "
81343	81346	81348	81348	Hagrid	282	" Never , "
81351	81376	81348	81348	Hagrid	282	" try an ' get a straight answer out of a centaur . Ruddy stargazers . Not interested in anythin ' closer'n the moon . "
81377	81386	81388	81388	Hermione	219	" Are there many of them in here ? "
81390	81439	81348	81348	Hagrid	282	" Oh , a fair few ... Keep themselves to themselves mostly , but they 're good enough about turnin ' up if ever I want a word . They 're deep , mind , centaurs ... they know things ... jus ' don ' let on much . "
81440	81451	81453	81453	Harry	282	" D'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier ? "
81455	81489	81453	81453	Harry	282	" Did that sound like hooves to you ? Nah , if yeh ask me , that was what 's bin killin ' the unicorns -- never heard anythin ' like it before . "
81547	81561	81541	81541	Hermione	219	" Hagrid ! Look ! Red sparks , the others are in trouble ! "
81562	81568	81569	81569	Hagrid	282	" You two wait here ! "
81572	81585	81569	81569	Hagrid	282	" Stay on the path , I 'll come back for yeh ! "
81618	81631	81633	81633	Hermione	219	" You do n't think they 've been hurt , do you ? "
81635	81663	81633	81633	Hermione	219	" I do n't care if Malfoy has , but if something 's got Neville ... it 's our fault he 's here in the first place . "
81755	81808	81809	81809	Hagrid	282	" We 'll be lucky ter catch anythin ' now , with the racket you two were makin ' . Right , we 're changin ' groups -- Neville , you stay with me an ' Hermione , Harry , you go with Fang an ' this idiot . I 'm sorry , "
81817	81839	81809	81809	Hagrid	282	" but he 'll have a harder time frightenin ' you , an ' we 've got ta get this done . "
81935	81938	81939	81939	he	282	" Look -- "
82096	82099	82078	82078	its	2133	" AAAAAAAAAARGH ! "
82263	82269	82271	82272	the centaur	2118	" Are you all right ? "
82280	82290	82271	82272	the centaur	2118	" Yes -- thank you -- what was that ? "
82330	82337	82338	82338	he	2118	" You are the Potter boy , "
82341	82373	82338	82338	he	2118	" You had better get back to Hagrid . The forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you . Can you ride ? It will be quicker this way .
82374	82380	82381	82381	he	2118	" My name is Firenze , "
82433	82436	82437	82437	Bane	352	" Firenze ! "
82440	82465	82437	82437	Bane	352	" What are you doing ? You have a human on your back ! Have you no shame ? Are you a common mule ? "
82466	82474	82476	82476	Firenze	354	" Do you realize who this is ? "
82478	82495	82476	82476	Firenze	354	" This is the Potter boy . The quicker he leaves this forest , the better . "
82496	82504	82506	82506	Bane	352	" What have you been telling him ? "
82508	82539	82506	82506	Bane	352	" Remember , Firenze , we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens . Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets ? "
82546	82559	82560	82560	he	350	" I 'm sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best , "
82575	82614	82567	82567	Bane	352	" For the best ! What is that to do with us ? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold ! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest ! "
82638	82646	82647	82647	Firenze	354	" Do you not see that unicorn ? "
82652	82697	82647	82647	Firenze	354	" Do you not understand why it was killed ? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret ? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest , Bane , yes , with humans alongside me if I must . "
82737	82744	82745	82745	he	282	" Why 's Bane so angry ? "
82748	82760	82745	82745	he	282	" What was that thing you saved me from , anyway ? "
82833	82847	82829	82829	Firenze	354	" Harry Potter , do you know what unicorn blood is used -for ? "
82848	82851	82853	82853	Harry	95	" No , "
82861	82874	82853	82853	Harry	95	" We 've only used the horn and tail hair in Potions . "
82875	82890	82892	82892	Firenze	354	" That is because it is a monstrous thing , to slay a unicorn , "
82894	82973	82892	82892	Firenze	354	" Only one who has nothing to lose , and everything to gain , would commit such a crime . The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive , even if you are an inch from death , but at a terrible price . You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself , and you will have but a half - life , a cursed life , from the moment the blood touches your lips . "
82992	83000	83001	83001	he	95	" But who 'd be that desperate ? "
83005	83022	83001	83001	he	95	" If you 're going to be cursed forever , deaths better , is n't it ? "
83023	83027	83028	83028	Firenze	354	" It is , "
83031	83085	83028	83028	Firenze	354	" unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back to full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die . Mr. Potter , do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment ? "
83086	83107	83001	83001	he	95	" The Sorcerer 's Stone ! Of course -- the Elixir of Life ! But I do n't understand who -- "
83108	83134	83028	83028	Firenze	354	" Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power , who has clung to life , awaiting their chance ? "
83175	83199	83164	83164	Hagrid	282	" Some say he died . Codswallop , in my opinion . Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die . "
83200	83205	83206	83206	Harry	282	" Do you mean , "
83209	83213	83206	83206	Harry	282	" that was Vol- "
83214	83224	83164	83164	Hagrid	282	" Harry ! Harry , are you all right ? "
83240	83245	83247	83247	Harry	282	" I 'm fine , "
83256	83272	83247	83247	Harry	282	" The unicorn 's dead , Hagrid , it 's in that clearing back there . "
83273	83281	83282	83282	Firenze	354	" This is where I leave you , "
83293	83299	83285	83285	Hagrid	282	" You are safe now . "
83306	83313	83315	83315	Firenze	354	" Good luck , Harry Potter , "
83317	83340	83315	83315	Firenze	354	" The planets have been read wrongly before now , even by centaurs . I hope this is one of those times . "
83438	83467	83433	83433	He	95	" Snape wants the stone for Voldemort ... and Voldemort 's waiting in the forest ... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich .... "
83468	83474	83476	83476	Ron	194	" Stop saying the name ! "
83496	83558	83484	83484	he	194	" Firenze saved me , but he should n't have done so .... Bane was furious ... he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen .... They must show that Voldemort 's coming back .... Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me .... I suppose that 's written in the stars as well . "
83559	83567	83568	83568	Ron	194	" Will you stop saying the name ! "
83571	83588	83589	83589	Harry	95	" So all I 've got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone , "
83594	83615	83589	83589	Harry	95	" then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off ... Well , I suppose Bane'll be happy . "
83629	83693	83622	83622	she	219	" Harry , everyone says Dumbledore 's the only one You - Know - Who was ever afraid of With Dumbledore around , You - Know - Who wo n't touch you . Anyway , who says the centaurs are right ? It sounds like fortune - telling to me , and Professor McGonagall says that 's a very imprecise branch of magic . "
84171	84183	84185	84185	Hermione	219	" That was far easier than I thought it would be , "
84198	84219	84185	84185	Hermione	219	" I need n't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager . "
84276	84281	84282	84282	Ron	194	" No more studying , "
84292	84324	84282	84282	Ron	194	" You could look more cheerful , Harry , we 've got a week before we find out how badly we 've done , there 's no need to worry yet . "
84331	84340	84341	84341	he	109	" I wish I knew what this means ! "
84346	84364	84341	84341	he	109	" My scar keeps hurting -- it 's happened before , but never as often as this . "
84365	84371	84372	84372	Hermione	219	" Go to Madam Pomfrey , "
84375	84381	84383	84383	Harry	109	" I 'm not ill , "
84385	84399	84383	84383	Harry	109	" I think it 's a warning ... it means danger 's coming .... "
84412	84483	84516	84516	Hermione	219	" Harry , relax , Hermione 's right , the Stone 's safe as long as Dumbledore 's around . Anyway , we 've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy . He nearly had his leg ripped off once , he 's not going to try it again in a hurry . And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down . "
84519	84547	84516	84516	Hermione	219	" That 's just the exams . I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we 'd done that one . "
84626	84632	84634	84634	Ron	194	" Where 're you going ? "
84637	84645	84647	84647	Harry	282	" I 've just thought of something , "
84654	84666	84649	84649	He	282	" We 've got to go and see Hagrid , now . "
84667	84670	84672	84672	Hermione	219	" Why ? "
84679	84690	84692	84692	Harry	282	" Do n't you think it 's a bit odd , "
84700	84762	84692	84692	Harry	282	" that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon , and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket ? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it 's against wizard law ? Lucky they found Hagrid , do n't you think ? Why did n't I see it before ? "
84763	84770	84772	84772	Ron	194	" What are you talking about ? "
84817	84820	84821	84821	he	282	" Hullo , "
84826	84837	84821	84821	he	282	" Finished yer exams ? Got time fer a drink ? "
84838	84843	84845	84845	Ron	194	" Yes , please , "
84853	84892	84821	84821	he	282	" No , we 're in a hurry . Hagrid , I 've got to ask you something . You know that night you won Norbert ? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like ? "
84893	84896	84898	84898	Hagrid	282	" Dunno , "
84901	84910	84898	84898	Hagrid	282	" he wouldn ' take his cloak off . "
84924	84976	84821	84821	he	282	" It 's not that unusual , yeh get a lot o ' funny folk in the Hog 's Head -- that 's the pub down in the village . Mighta bin a dragon dealer , mightn ' he ? I never saw his face , he kept his hood up . "
84987	85005	84977	84977	Harry	282	" What did you talk to him about , Hagrid ? Did you mention Hogwarts at all ? "
85006	85011	85013	85013	Hagrid	282	" Mighta come up , "
85022	85154	85013	85013	Hagrid	282	" Yeah ... he asked what I did , an ' I told him I was gamekeeper here .... He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after ... so I told him ... an ' I said what I 'd always really wanted was a dragon ... an ' then ... I can ' remember too well , 'cause he kept buyin ' me drinks .... Let 's see ... yeah , then he said he had the dragon egg an ' we could play cards fer it if I wanted ... but he had ter be sure I could handle it , he didn ' want it ter go ter any old home .... So I told him , after Fluffy , a dragon would be easy ... "
85155	85167	85168	85168	Harry	282	" And did he -- did he seem interested in Fluffy ? "
85179	85237	85013	85013	Hagrid	282	" Well -- yeah -- how many three - headed dogs d'yeh meet , even around Hogwarts ? So I told him , Fluffy 's a piece o ' cake if yeh know how to calm him down , jus ' play him a bit o ' music an ' he 'll go straight off ter sleep -- "
85243	85250	85251	85251	he	282	" I shouldn'ta told yeh that ! "
85255	85268	85251	85251	he	282	" Forget I said it ! Hey -- where 're yeh goin' ? "
85304	85313	85315	85315	Harry	282	" We 've got to go to Dumbledore , "
85317	85377	85315	85315	Harry	282	" Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy , and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak -- it must 've been easy , once he 'd got Hagrid drunk . I just hope Dumbledore believes us . Firenze might back us up if Bane does n't stop him . Where 's Dumbledore 's office ? "
85418	85425	85426	85426	Harry	282	" We 'll just have to -- "
85438	85446	85449	85450	Professor McGonagall	109	" What are you three doing inside ? "
85459	85467	85469	85469	Hermione	219	" We want to see Professor Dumbledore , "
85479	85484	85485	85486	Professor McGonagall	109	" See Professor Dumbledore ? "
85502	85505	85485	85486	Professor McGonagall	109	" Why ? "
85512	85519	85520	85520	he	109	" It 's sort of secret , "
85539	85547	85548	85548	she	219	" Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago , "
85552	85571	85548	85548	she	219	" He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once . "
85572	85577	85579	85579	Harry	109	" He 's gone ? "
85582	85585	85579	85579	Harry	109	" Now ? "
85586	85604	85548	85548	she	219	" Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard , Potter , he has many demands on his time --
85605	85611	85579	85579	Harry	109	" But this is important . "
85612	85628	85548	85548	she	219	" Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic , Potter .
85629	85632	85634	85634	Harry	95	" Look , "
85642	85653	85634	85634	Harry	95	" Professor -- it 's about the Sorcerer 's tone -- "
85684	85691	85692	85692	she	219	" How do you know -- ? "
85695	85726	85727	85727	She	219	" Professor , I think -- I know -- that Sn- that someone 's going to try and steal the Stone . I 've got to talk to Professor Dumbledore . "
85738	85746	85747	85747	she	219	" Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow , "
85780	85780	85802	85802	She	219	"
85781	85785	85747	85747	she	219	" But Professor -- "
85786	85797	85798	85798	she	219	" Potter , I know what I 'm talking about , "
85824	85824	85812	85812	I	0	"
85830	85835	85837	85837	Harry	95	" It 's tonight , "
85850	85899	85837	85837	Harry	95	" Snape 's going through the trapdoor tonight . He 's found out everything he needs , and now he 's got Dumbledore out of the way . He sent that note , I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up . "
85900	85906	85926	85926	he	265	" But what can we -- "
85921	85925	85926	85926	he	265	" Good afternoon , "
85935	85947	85948	85948	he	265	" You should n't be inside on a day like this , "
85958	85962	85963	85963	Harry	109	" We were -- "
85976	85984	85986	85986	Snape	265	" You want to be more careful , "
85988	85990	85986	85986	Snape	265	" Hanging around
86018	86018	86029	86029	Snape	265	"
86034	86059	86060	86060	He	265	" Be warned , Potter -- any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled . Good day to you . "
86082	86094	86095	86095	he	95	" Right , here 's what we 've got to do , "
86099	86133	86095	86095	he	95	" One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape -- wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it . Hermione , you 'd better do that . "
86134	86138	86076	86076	Harry	95	" Why me ? "
86139	86144	86146	86146	Ron	194	" It 's obvious , "
86148	86162	86163	86163	He	265	" You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick , you know . "
86170	86191	86163	86163	He	265	" ' Oh Professor Flitwick , I 'm so worried , I think I got question fourteen b wrong .... ' "
86192	86198	86203	86203	she	219	" Oh , shut up , "
86213	86226	86227	86227	Harry	95	" And we 'd better stay outside the third - floor corridor , "
86231	86235	86227	86227	Harry	95	" Come on . "
86276	86293	86294	86294	she	219	" I suppose you think you 're harder to get past than a pack of enchantments ! "
86297	86333	86294	86294	she	219	" Enough of this nonsense ! If I hear you ' ve come anywhere near here again , I 'll take another fifty points from Gryffindor ! Yes , Weasley , from my own house ! "
86349	86359	86344	86344	Harry	109	" At least Hermione 's on Snape 's tail , "
86374	86381	86382	86382	she	219	" I 'm sorry , Harry ! "
86385	86429	86382	86382	she	219	" Snape came out and asked me what I was doing , so I said I was waiting for Flitwick , and Snape went to get him , and I 've only just got away , I do n't know where Snape went . "
86430	86442	86443	86443	Harry	109	" Well , that 's it then , is n't it ? "
86462	86483	86457	86457	his	109	" I 'm going out of here tonight and I 'm going to try and get to the Stone first . "
86484	86489	86491	86491	Ron	194	" You 're mad ! "
86493	86498	86500	86500	Hermione	219	" You ca n't ! "
86502	86516	86500	86500	Hermione	219	" After what McGonagall and Snape have said ? You 'll be expelled ! "
86517	86520	86521	86521	Harry	109	" SO WHAP "
86524	86695	86521	86521	Harry	109	" Do n't you understand ? If Snape gets hold of the Stone , Voldemort 's coming back ! Have n't you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over ? There wo n't be any Hogwarts to get expelled from ! He 'll flatten it , or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts ! Losing points does n't matter anymore , ca n't you see ? D'you think he 'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup ? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone , well , I 'll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there , it 's only dying a bit later than I would have , because I 'm never going over to the Dark Side ! I 'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me ! Voldemort killed my parents , remember ? "
86701	86707	86709	86709	Hermione	219	" You 're right Harry , "
86715	86723	86725	86725	Harry	109	" I 'll use the invisibility cloak , "
86727	86737	86725	86725	Harry	109	" It 's just lucky I got it back . "
86738	86748	86750	86750	Ron	194	" But will it cover all three of us ? "
86752	86760	86725	86725	Harry	109	" All -- all three of us ? "
86761	86779	86725	86725	Harry	109	" Oh , come off it , you do n't think we 'd let you go alone ? "
86780	86785	86787	86787	Hermione	219	" Of course not , "
86790	86820	86787	86787	Hermione	219	" How do you think you 'd get to the Stone without us ? I 'd better go and took through my books , there might be something useful ... "
86821	86836	86725	86725	Harry	109	" But if we get caught , you two will be expelled , too . "
86837	86845	86847	86847	Hermione	219	" Not if I can help it , "
86850	86877	86847	86847	Hermione	219	" Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam . They 're not throwing me out after that . "
86982	86988	86989	86989	Ron	194	" Better get the cloak , "
87055	87088	87046	87046	He	109	" We 'd better put the cloak on here , and make sure it covers all three of us -- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own -- "
87089	87095	87150	87150	Neville	197	" What are you doing ? "
87131	87138	87140	87140	Harry	282	" Nothing , Neville , nothing , "
87157	87164	87165	87165	he	197	" You 're going out again , "
87168	87175	87177	87177	Hermione	219	" No , no , no , "
87179	87196	87177	87177	Hermione	219	" No , we 're not . Why do n't you go to bed , Neville ? "
87227	87234	87236	87236	Neville	197	" You ca n't go out , "
87238	87253	87236	87236	Neville	197	" you 'll be caught again . Gryffindor will be in even more trouble . "
87254	87260	87262	87262	Harry	282	" You do n't understand , "
87264	87269	87262	87262	Harry	282	" this is important . "
87289	87303	87304	87304	I	0	" he said , hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole . "
87312	87312	87304	87304	I	0	"
87313	87316	87317	87317	Ron	194	" Neville , "
87320	87333	87317	87317	Ron	194	" get away from that hole and do n't be an idiot -- "
87334	87343	87345	87345	Neville	197	" Do n't you call me an idiot ! "
87373	87373	87360	87360	you	197	"
87374	87382	87384	87384	Ron	194	" Yes , but not to us , "
87388	87400	87384	87384	Ron	194	" Neville , you do n't know what you 're doing . "
87419	87429	87431	87431	Neville	197	" Go on then , try and hit me ! "
87437	87442	87431	87431	Neville	197	" I 'm ready ! "
87448	87452	87453	87453	he	282	" Do something , "
87461	87464	87465	87465	she	219	" Neville , "
87468	87478	87465	87465	she	219	" I 'm really , really sorry about this . "
87484	87488	87489	87489	she	219	" Petrificus Totalus ! "
87564	87572	87573	87573	Harry	282	" What 've you done to him ? "
87576	87585	87587	87587	Hermione	219	" It 's the full Body - Bind , "
87590	87600	87587	87587	Hermione	219	" Oh , Neville , I 'm so sorry . "
87601	87613	87615	87615	Harry	282	" We had to , Neville , no time to explain , "
87617	87625	87627	87627	Ron	194	" You 'll understand later , Neville , "
87702	87714	87715	87715	Ron	194	" Oh , let 's kick her , just this once , "
87782	87787	87788	87788	he	230	" Who 's there ? "
87804	87828	87797	87797	He	230	" Know you 're there , even if I ca n't see you . Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie ? "
87843	87860	87829	87829	He	230	" Should call Filch , I should , if something 's a - creeping around unseen . "
87867	87870	87871	87871	he	282	" Peeves , "
87879	87891	87871	87871	he	282	" the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible . "
87916	87928	87929	87929	he	230	" So sorry , your bloodiness , Mr. Baron , Sir , "
87933	87965	87929	87929	he	230	" My mistake , my mistake -- I did n't see you -- of course I did n't , you 're invisible -- forgive old Peevsie his little joke , sir . "
87966	87974	87976	87976	Harry	282	" I have business here , Peeves , "
87978	87986	87976	87976	Harry	282	" Stay away from this place tonight . "
87987	87998	88000	88000	Peeves	230	" I will , sir , I most certainly will , "
88009	88024	88000	88000	Peeves	230	" Hope your business goes well , Baron , I 'll not bother you . "
88029	88034	88036	88036	Ron	194	" Brilliant , Harry ! "
88061	88068	88069	88069	Harry	282	" Well , there you are , "
88073	88081	88069	88069	Harry	282	" Snape 's already got past Fluffy . "
88111	88125	88126	88126	he	282	" If you want to go back , I wo n't blame you , "
88129	88143	88126	88126	he	282	" You can take the cloak , I wo n't need it now . "
88144	88150	88152	88152	Ron	194	" Do n't be stupid , "
88154	88159	88161	88161	Hermione	219	" We 're coming , "
88203	88211	88212	88212	Hermione	219	" What 's that at its feet ? "
88215	88221	88223	88223	Ron	194	" Looks like a harp , "
88225	88233	88223	88223	Ron	194	" Snape must have left it there . "
88234	88245	88247	88247	Harry	282	" It must wake up the moment you stop playing , "
88249	88255	88247	88247	Harry	282	" Well , here goes ... "
88321	88325	88326	88326	Ron	194	" Keep playing , "
88359	88372	88374	88374	Ron	194	" I think we 'll be able to pull the door open , "
88383	88391	88374	88374	Ron	194	" Want to go first , Hermione ? "
88392	88399	88407	88407	his	194	" No , I do n't ! "
88400	88404	88405	88405	Ron	194	" All right . "
88434	88440	88441	88441	Hermione	219	" What can you see ? "
88445	88466	88441	88441	Hermione	219	" Nothing -- just black -- there 's no way of climbing down , we 'll just have to drop . "
88488	88499	88501	88501	Ron	194	" You want to go first ? Are you sure ? "
88503	88526	88501	88501	Ron	194	" I do n't know how deep this thing goes . Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep . "
88605	88629	88597	88597	he	282	" If anything happens to me , do n't follow . Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore , right ? "
88630	88633	88635	88635	Ron	194	" Right , "
88637	88646	88597	88597	he	282	" See you in a minute , I hope ...
88713	88718	88719	88719	he	282	" It 's okay ! "
88738	88749	88719	88719	he	282	" it 's a soft landing , you can jump ! "
88763	88769	88771	88771	his	194	" What 's this stuff ? "
88775	88799	88755	88755	He	194	" Dunno , some sort of plant thing . I suppose it 's here to break the fall . Come on , Hermione ! "
88828	88839	88820	88820	She	219	" We must be miles under the school , she said .
88840	88850	88852	88852	Ron	194	" Lucky this plant thing 's here , really , "
88854	88857	88859	88859	Hermione	219	" Lucky ! "
88861	88867	88859	88859	Hermione	219	" Look at you both ! "
88972	88976	88977	88977	Hermione	219	" Stop moving ! "
88981	88994	88977	88977	Hermione	219	" I know what this is -- it 's Devil 's Snare ! "
88995	89015	89017	89017	Ron	194	" Oh , I 'm so glad we know what it 's called , that 's a great help , "
89033	89047	89049	89049	Hermione	219	" Shut up , I 'm trying to remember how to kill it ! "
89051	89062	89063	89063	Harry	282	" Well , hurry up , I ca n't breathe ! "
89076	89098	89063	89063	Harry	282	" Devil 's Snare , Devil 's Snare ... what did Professor Sprout say ? -- it likes the dark and the damp
89099	89105	89106	89106	Harry	282	" So light a fire ! "
89109	89121	89122	89122	Hermione	219	" Yes -- of course -- but there 's no wood ! "
89129	89135	89136	89136	Ron	194	" HAVE YOU GONE MAD ? "
89139	89147	89136	89136	Ron	194	" ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT ? "
89148	89153	89155	89155	Hermione	219	" Oh , right ! "
89231	89241	89243	89243	Harry	282	" Lucky you pay attention in Herbology , Hermione , "
89258	89261	89263	89263	Ron	194	" Yeah , "
89265	89287	89263	89263	Ron	194	" and lucky Harry does n't lose his head in a crisis -- ' there 's no wood , ' honestly . "
89288	89292	89294	89294	Harry	282	" This way , "
89381	89387	89388	89388	Ron	194	" Can you hear something ? "
89407	89416	89388	89388	Ron	194	" Do you think it 's a ghost ? "
89417	89429	89388	89388	Ron	194	" I do n't know ... sounds like wings to me . "
89430	89442	89388	89388	Ron	194	" There 's light ahead -- I can see something moving . "
89498	89512	89514	89514	Ron	194	" Do you think they 'll attack us if we cross the room ? "
89516	89519	89521	89521	Harry	282	" Probably , "
89523	89554	89521	89521	Harry	282	" They do n't look very vicious , but I suppose if they all swooped down at once ... well , there 's no other choice ... I 'll run . "
89637	89641	89643	89643	Ron	194	" Now what ? "
89645	89658	89660	89660	Hermione	219	" These birds ... they ca n't be here just for decoration , "
89673	89679	89680	89680	Harry	282	" They 're not birds ! "
89684	89700	89701	89701	he	282	" They 're keys ! Winged keys -- look carefully . So that must mean ... "
89718	89737	89701	89701	he	282	" ... yes -- look ! Broomsticks ! We 've got to catch the key to the door ! "
89738	89746	89747	89747	Ron	194	" But there are hundreds of them ! "
89755	89775	89747	89747	Ron	194	" We 're looking for a big , old - fashioned one -- probably silver , like the handle . "
89886	89890	89891	89891	he	282	" That one ! "
89897	89922	89891	89891	he	282	" That big one -- there -- no , there -- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side . "
89946	89956	89957	89957	Harry	282	" We 've got to close in on it ! "
89972	90004	89957	89957	Harry	282	" Ron , you come at it from above -- Hermione , stay below and stop it from going down and I 'll try and catch it . Right , NOW ! "
90116	90119	90120	90120	Harry	282	" Ready ? "
90235	90242	90243	90243	Harry	282	" Now what do we do ? "
90246	90255	90257	90257	Ron	194	" It 's obvious , is n't it ? "
90259	90271	90257	90257	Ron	194	" We 've got to play our way across the room . "
90282	90285	90287	90287	Hermione	219	" How ? "
90290	90294	90296	90296	Ron	194	" I think , "
90298	90308	90296	90296	Ron	194	" we 're going to have to be chessmen . "
90355	90369	90370	90372	The black knight	2244	" Do we -- er -- have to join you to get across ? "
90382	90406	90375	90375	Ron	194	" This needs thinking about he said . I suppose we 've got to take the place of three of the black pieces .... "
90421	90441	90418	90418	he	194	" Now , do n't be offended or anything , but neither of you are that good at chess -- "
90442	90448	90450	90450	Harry	282	" We 're not offended , "
90453	90461	90450	90450	Harry	282	" Just tell us what to do . "
90462	90488	90418	90418	he	194	" Well , Harry , you take the place of that bishop , and Hermione , YOU 90 next to him instead of that castle . "
90489	90494	90450	90450	Harry	282	" What about you ? "
90495	90504	90506	90506	Ron	194	" I 'm going to be a knight , "
90555	90563	90565	90565	Ron	194	" White always plays first in chess , "
90572	90577	90565	90565	Ron	194	" Yes ... look ... "
90614	90625	90599	90599	he	194	" Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right . "
90661	90668	90670	90670	Ron	194	" Had to let that happen , "
90675	90689	90670	90670	Ron	194	" Leaves you free to take that bishop , Hermione , go on . "
90756	90762	90763	90763	he	194	" We 're nearly there , "
90767	90775	90763	90763	he	194	" Let me think let me think ... "
90786	90789	90791	90791	Ron	194	" Yes ... "
90794	90808	90791	90791	Ron	194	" It 's the only way ... I 've got to be taken . "
90809	90815	90776	90778	The white queen	2252	" NOF Harry and Hermione shouted .
90816	90821	90823	90823	Ron	194	" That 's chess ! "
90825	90856	90823	90823	Ron	194	" You 've got to make some sacrifices ! I take one step forward and she 'll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate the king , Harry ! "
90857	90860	90776	90778	The white queen	2252	" But -- "
90861	90871	90823	90823	Ron	194	" Do you want to stop Snape or not ? "
90872	90875	90776	90778	The white queen	2252	" Ron -- "
90876	90893	90823	90823	Ron	194	" Look , if you do n't hurry up , he 'll already have the Stone ! "
90899	90902	90903	90903	Ron	194	" Ready ? "
90912	90928	90906	90906	his	194	" Here I go - now , do n't hang around once you 've won . "
91048	91055	91037	91037	Hermione	219	" What if he 's -- ? "
91056	91063	91065	91065	Harry	282	" He 'll be all right , "
91072	91080	91065	91065	Harry	282	" What do you reckon 's next ? "
91081	91123	91037	91037	Hermione	219	" We 've had Sprout 's , that was the Devil 's Snare ; Flitwick must 've put charms on the keys ; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive ; that leaves Quirrell 's spell , and Snape 's . "
91130	91134	91135	91135	Harry	109	" All right ? "
91138	91142	91143	91143	Harry	109	" Go on . "
91203	91216	91217	91217	Harry	109	" I 'm glad we did n't have to fight that one , "
91230	91239	91217	91217	Harry	109	" Come on , I ca n't breathe . "
91283	91287	91289	91289	Harry	109	" Snape 's , "
91291	91299	91289	91289	Harry	109	" What do we have to do ? "
91348	91351	91352	91352	Hermione	219	" Look ! "
91574	91577	91579	91579	Hermione	219	" Brilliant , "
91581	91616	91579	91579	Hermione	219	" This is n't magic -- it 's logic -- a puzzle . A lot of the greatest wizards have n't got an ounce of logic , they 'd be stuck in here forever . "
91617	91627	91561	91561	she	219	" But so will we , wo n't we ? "
91628	91633	91635	91635	Hermione	219	" Of course not , "
91637	91678	91635	91635	Hermione	219	" Everything we need is here on this paper . Seven bottles : three are poison ; two are wine ; one will get us safely through the black fire , and one will get us back through the purple . "
91679	91689	91561	91561	she	219	" But how do we know which to drink ? "
91690	91696	91635	91635	Hermione	219	" Give me a minute . "
91731	91735	91736	91736	she	219	" Got it , "
91739	91755	91726	91726	she	219	" The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire -- toward the Stone . "
91763	91774	91775	91775	he	109	" There 's only enough there for one of us , "
91778	91785	91775	91775	he	109	" That 's hardly one swallow . "
91792	91804	91786	91786	They	2275	" Which one will get you back through the purple flames ? "
91819	91824	91826	91826	Harry	109	" You drink that , "
91828	91896	91826	91826	Harry	109	" No , listen , get back and get Ron . Grab brooms from the flying- key room , they 'll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore , we need him . I might be able to hold Snape off for a while , but I 'm no match for him , really . "
91897	91912	91942	91942	Hermione	219	" But Harry -- what if You - Know - Who 's with him ? "
91913	91925	91927	91927	Harry	109	" Well -- I was lucky once , was n't I ? "
91934	91941	91927	91927	Harry	109	" I might get lucky again . "
91960	91963	91948	91948	she	219	" Hermione ! "
91964	91976	91948	91948	she	219	" Harry -- you 're a great wizard , you know . "
91977	91986	91988	91988	Harry	109	" I 'm not as good as you , "
92000	92003	92005	92005	Hermione	219	" Me ! "
92007	92030	92005	92005	Hermione	219	" Books ! And cleverness ! There are more important things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be careful ! "
92031	92036	92038	92038	Harry	109	" You drink first , "
92040	92052	92038	92038	Harry	109	" You are sure which is which , are n't you ? "
92053	92056	92058	92058	Hermione	219	" Positive , "
92076	92082	92084	92084	Harry	109	" It 's not poison ? "
92087	92096	92120	92120	Hermione	219	" No -- but it 's like ice . "
92097	92107	92038	92038	Harry	109	" Quick , go , before it wears off . "
92108	92115	92120	92120	Hermione	219	" Good luck -- take care . "
92116	92119	92038	92038	Harry	109	" GO ! "
92150	92155	92156	92156	he	109	" Here I come , "
92260	92263	92265	92265	Harry	109	" You ! "
92278	92281	92282	92282	he	338	" Me , "
92286	92299	92282	92282	he	338	" I wondered whether I 'd be meeting you here , Potter . "
92300	92307	92282	92282	he	338	" But I thought -- Snape -- "
92308	92311	92312	92312	Quirrell	338	" Severus ? "
92331	92377	92312	92312	Quirrell	338	" Yes , Severus does seem the type , does n't he ? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat . Next to him , who would suspect p - p - poor , st - stuttering P - Professor Quirrell ? "
92395	92403	92282	92282	he	338	" But Snape tried to kill me ! "
92404	92480	92282	92282	he	338	" No , no , no . I tried to kill you . Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match . She broke my eye contact with you . Another few seconds and I 'd have got you off that broom . I 'd have managed it before then if Snape had n't been muttering a countercurse , trying to save you . "
92481	92489	92282	92282	he	338	" Snape was trying to save me ? "
92490	92494	92496	92496	Quirrell	169	" Of course , "
92499	92584	92496	92496	Quirrell	169	" \Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match ? He was trying to make sure I did n't do it again . Funny , really ... he need n't have bothered . I could n't do anything with Dumbledore watching . All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning , he did make himself unpopular ... and what a waste of time , when after all that , I 'm going to kill you tonight . "
92603	92640	92587	92587	his	169	" You 're too nosy to live , Potter . Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that , for all I knew you 'd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone . "
92641	92648	92587	92587	his	169	" You let the troll in ? "
92649	92735	92587	92587	his	169	" Certainly . I have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there ? Unfortunately , while everyone else was running around looking for it , Snape , who already suspected me , went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death , that three - headed dog did n't even manage to bite Snape 's leg off properly .
92736	92751	92587	92587	his	169	" Now , wait quietly , Potter . I need to examine this interesting mirror .
92772	92783	92784	92784	Quirrell	169	" This mirror is the key to finding the Stone , "
92794	92823	92788	92788	his	169	" Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this ... but he 's in London ... I 'll be far away by the time he gets back .... "
92844	92854	92855	92855	he	95	" I saw you and Snape in the forest -- "
92859	92862	92864	92864	Quirrell	169	" Yes , "
92877	92922	92864	92864	Quirrell	169	" He was on to me by that time , trying to find out how far I 'd got . He suspected me all along . Tried to frighten me - as though he could , when I had Lord Voldemort on my side .... "
92937	92956	92923	92923	Quirrell	169	" I see the Stone ... I 'm presenting it to my master ... but where is it ? "
92985	92996	92971	92971	He	95	" But Snape always seemed to hate me so much . "
92997	93003	93005	93005	Quirrell	169	" Oh , he does , "
93008	93038	93005	93005	Quirrell	169	" heavens , yes . He was at Hogwarts with your father , did n't you know ? They loathed each other . But he never wanted you dead . "
93039	93058	92971	92971	He	95	" But I heard you a few days ago , sobbing -- I thought Snape was threatening you .... "
93074	93077	93078	93078	he	169	" Sometimes , "
93081	93103	93078	93078	he	169	" I find it hard to follow my master 's instructions -- he is a great wizard and I am weak -- "
93104	93116	93117	93117	Harry	95	" You mean he was there in the classroom with you ? "
93120	93129	93131	93131	Quirrell	169	" He is with me wherever I go , "
93134	93219	93131	93131	Quirrell	169	" I met him when I traveled around the world . A foolish young man I was then , full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil . Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was . There is no good and evil , there is only power , and those too weak to seek it .... Since then , I have served him faithfully , although I have let him down many times . He has had to be very hard on me . "
93224	93263	93220	93220	Quirrell	169	" He does not forgive mistakes easily . When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts , he was most displeased . He punished me ... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me .... "
93310	93328	93307	93307	his	169	" I do n't understand ... is the Stone inside the mirror ? Should I break it ? "
93446	93463	93439	93439	He	169	" What does this mirror do ? How does it work ? Help me , Master ! "
93483	93492	93482	93482	himself	169	" Use the boy ... Use the boy ... "
93498	93506	93493	93493	Quirrell	169	" Yes -- Potter -- come here . "
93528	93532	93533	93533	Quirrell	169	" Come here , "
93536	93548	93533	93533	Quirrell	169	" Look in the mirror and tell me what you see . "
93691	93694	93696	93696	Quirrell	169	" Well ? "
93699	93705	93696	93696	Quirrell	169	" What do you see ? "
93712	93721	93722	93722	he	95	" I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore , "
93725	93737	93722	93722	he	95	" I -- I 've won the house cup for Gryffindor . "
93742	93749	93750	93750	he	169	" Get out of the way , "
93797	93804	93829	93831	The high voice	2286	" He lies ... He lies ... "
93805	93812	93813	93813	Quirrell	169	" Potter , come back here ! "
93816	93828	93813	93813	Quirrell	169	" Tell me the truth ! What did you just see ? "
93835	93848	93829	93831	The high voice	2286	" Let me speak to him ... face - to - face ... "
93849	93858	93829	93831	The high voice	2286	" Master , you are not strong enough ! "
93859	93868	93829	93831	The high voice	2286	" I have strength enough ... for this .... "
93988	93992	93996	93996	Harry	95	" Harry Potter ... "
94010	94017	93996	93996	Harry	95	" See what I have become ? "
94022	94113	93996	93996	Harry	95	" Mere shadow and vapor ... I have form only when I can share another 's body ... but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds .... Unicorn blood has strengthened me , these past weeks ... you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest ... and once I have the Elixir of Life , I will be able to create a body of my own .... Now ... why do n't you give me that Stone in your pocket ? "
94132	94139	93996	93996	Harry	95	" Do n't be a fool , "
94144	94172	93996	93996	Harry	95	" Better save your own life and join me ... or you 'll meet the same end as your parents .... They died begging me for mercy ... "
94173	94176	94177	94177	Harry	95	" LIAR ! "
94203	94207	93996	93996	Harry	95	" How touching ... "
94211	94271	93996	93996	Harry	95	" I always value bravery ... Yes , boy , your parents were brave .... I killed your father first ; and he put up a courageous fight ... but your mother need n't have died ... she was trying to protect you .... Now give me the Stone , unless you want her to have died in vain . "
94272	94275	94298	94298	Quirrell	169	" NEVER ! "
94286	94290	94284	94284	Voldemort	113	" SEIZE HIM ! "
94390	94397	94399	94399	Voldemort	113	" Seize him ! SEIZE HIM ! "
94445	94460	94462	94462	Quirrell	169	" Master , I can not hold him -- my hands -- my hands ! "
94503	94514	94516	94516	Voldemort	113	" Then kill him , fool , and be done ! "
94542	94545	94529	94529	Harry	95	" AAAARGH ! "
94657	94664	94647	94647	Quirrell	169	" KILL HIM ! KILL HIM ! "
94678	94683	94647	94647	Quirrell	169	" Harry ! Harry ! "
94771	94777	94779	94779	Dumbledore	108	" Good afternoon , Harry , "
94790	94810	94781	94781	Harry	95	" Sir ! The Stone ! It was Quirrell ! He 's got the Stone ! Sir , quick -- "
94811	94826	94828	94828	Dumbledore	108	" Calm yourself , dear boy , you are a little behind the times , "
94830	94838	94828	94828	Dumbledore	108	" Quirrell does not have the Stone . "
94839	94848	94781	94781	Harry	95	" Then who does ? Sir , I -- "
94849	94863	94828	94828	Dumbledore	108	" Harry , please relax , or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out .
94910	94918	94920	94920	Dumbledore	108	" Tokens from your friends and admirers , "
94924	94996	94920	94920	Dumbledore	108	" What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret , so , naturally , the whole school knows . I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat . No doubt they thought it would amuse you . Madam Pomfrey , however , felt it might not be very hygienic , and confiscated it . "
94997	95006	95039	95039	I	0	" How long have I been in here ? "
95007	95032	94920	94920	Dumbledore	108	" Three days . Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round , they have been extremely worried . "
95033	95038	95039	95039	I	0	" But sit , the Stone
95087	95098	94920	94920	Dumbledore	108	" You got there ? You got Hermione 's owl ? "
95099	95144	95039	95039	I	0	" We must have crossed in midair . No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left . I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you . "
95145	95150	94920	94920	Dumbledore	108	" It was you . "
95151	95160	95039	95039	I	0	" I feared I might be too late . "
95161	95178	94920	94920	Dumbledore	108	" You nearly were , I could n't have kept him off the Stone much longer -- "
95179	95217	95039	95039	I	0	" Not the Stone , boy , you -- the effort involved nearly killed you . For one terrible moment there , I was afraid it had . As for the Stone , it has been destroyed . "
95218	95221	95223	95223	Harry	95	" Destroyed ? "
95226	95234	95223	95223	Harry	95	" But your friend -- Nicolas Flamel -- "
95235	95243	95245	95245	Dumbledore	211	" Oh , you know about Nicolas ? "
95251	95283	95245	95245	Dumbledore	211	" You did do the thing properly , did n't you ? Well , Nicolas and I have had a little chat , and agreed it 's all for the best . "
95284	95299	95039	95039	I	0	" But that means he and his wife will die , wo n't they ? "
95300	95321	95245	95245	Dumbledore	211	" They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then , yes , they will die . "
95334	95442	95443	95443	Harry	95	" To one as young as you , I 'm sure it seems incredible , but to Nicolas and Perenelle , it really is like going to bed after a very , very long day . After all , to the well - organized mind , death is but the next great adventure . You know , the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing . As much money and life as you could want ! The two things most human beings would choose above all -- the trouble is , humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them . "
95461	95464	95466	95466	Harry	95	" Sir ? "
95468	95493	95466	95466	Harry	95	" I 've been thinking ... sir -- even if the Stone 's gone , Vol- , I mean , You - Know- Who -- "
95494	95520	95443	95443	Harry	95	" Call him Voldemort , Harry . Always use the proper name for things . Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself . "
95521	95554	95466	95466	Harry	95	" Yes , sir . Well , Voldemort 's going to try other ways of coming back , is n't he ? I mean , he has n't gone , has he ? "
95555	95662	95443	95443	Harry	95	" No , Harry , he has not . He is still out there somewhere , perhaps looking for another body to share ... not being truly alive , he can not be killed . He left Quirrell to die ; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies . Nevertheless , Harry , while you may only have delayed his return to power , it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if he is delayed again , and again , why , he may never return to power . "
95681	95710	95678	95678	he	95	" Sir , there are some other things I 'd like to know , if you can tell me ... things I want to know the truth about .... "
95711	95715	95716	95716	Dumbledore	211	" The truth . "
95719	95773	95716	95716	Dumbledore	211	" It is a beautiful and terrible thing , and should therefore be treated with great caution . However , I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to , in which case I beg you 'll forgive me . I shall not , of course , lie . "
95774	95808	95678	95678	he	95	" Well ... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me . But why would he want to kill me in the first place ? "
95816	95877	95678	95678	he	95	" Alas , the first thing you ask me , I can not tell you . Not today . Not now . You will know , one day ... put it from your mind for now , Harry . When you are older ... I know you hate to hear this ... when you are ready , you will know . "
95889	95898	95678	95678	he	95	" But why could n't Quirrell touch me ? "
95899	96017	95678	95678	he	95	" Your mother died to save you . If there is one thing Voldemort can not understand , it is love . He did n't realize that love as powerful as your mother 's for you leaves its own mark . Not a scar , no visible sign ... to have been loved so deeply , even though the person who loved us is gone , will give us some protection forever . It is in your very skin . Quirrell , full of hatred , greed , and ambition , sharing his soul with Voldemort , could not touch you for this reason . It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good . "
96054	96069	96051	96051	Harry	95	" And the invisibility cloak - do you know who sent it to me ? "
96070	96091	96092	96092	Dumbledore	211	" Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession , and I thought you might like it . "
96097	96120	96092	96092	Dumbledore	211	" Useful things ... your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here . "
96121	96128	96051	96051	Harry	95	" And there 's something else ... "
96129	96133	96092	96092	Dumbledore	211	" Fire away . "
96134	96139	96051	96051	Harry	95	" Quirrell said Snape -- "
96140	96146	96092	96092	Dumbledore	211	" Professor Snape , Harry . "
96147	96167	96051	96051	Harry	95	" Yes , him -- Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father . Is that true ? "
96168	96197	96092	96092	Dumbledore	211	" Well , they did rather detest each other . Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy . And then , your father did something Snape could never forgive . "
96198	96201	96051	96051	Harry	95	" What ? "
96202	96208	96092	96092	Dumbledore	211	" He saved his life . "
96209	96212	96051	96051	Harry	95	" What ? "
96213	96216	96218	96218	Dumbledore	211	" Yes ... "
96221	96285	96218	96218	Dumbledore	211	" Funny , the way people 's minds work , is n't it ? Professor Snape could n't bear being in your father 's debt .... I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even . Then he could go back to hating your father 's memory in peace .... "
96302	96312	96299	96299	he	95	" And sir , there 's one more thing ... "
96313	96318	96051	96051	Harry	95	" Just the one ? "
96319	96331	96299	96299	he	95	" How did I get the Stone out of the mirror ? "
96332	96482	96051	96051	Harry	95	" Ah , now , I 'm glad you asked me that . It was one of my more brilliant ideas , and between you and me , that 's saying something . You see , only one who wanted to find the Stone -- find it , but not use it -- would be able to get it , otherwise they 'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life . My brain surprises even me sometimes .... Now , enough questions . I suggest you make a start on these sweets . Ah ! Bettie Bott 's Every Flavor Beans ! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one , and since then I 'm afraid I 've rather lost my liking for them -- but I think I 'll be safe with a nice toffee , do n't you ? "
96502	96508	96497	96497	he	2292	" Alas ! Ear wax ! "
96524	96529	96530	96530	Harry	95	" Just five minutes , "
96533	96537	96512	96513	the nurse	2293	" Absolutely not . "
96538	96545	96512	96513	the nurse	2293	" You let Professor Dumbledore in ... "
96546	96564	96512	96513	the nurse	2293	" Well , of course , that was the headmaster , quite different . You need rest . "
96565	96585	96512	96513	the nurse	2293	" I am resting , look , lying down and everything . Oh , go on , Madam Pomfrey ... "
96586	96592	96593	96593	she	114	" Oh , very well , "
96596	96602	96593	96593	she	114	" But five minutes only . "
96611	96614	96604	96604	she	114	" Harry ! "
96642	96660	96630	96630	she	219	" Oh , Harry , we were sure you were going to -- Dumbledore was so worried -- "
96661	96670	96672	96672	Ron	194	" The whole school 's talking about it , "
96674	96679	96672	96672	Ron	194	" What really happened ? "
96752	96759	96761	96761	Ron	194	" So the Stone 's gone ? "
96764	96772	96761	96761	Ron	194	" Flamel 's just going to die ? "
96773	96805	96747	96747	Hermione	219	" That 's what I said , but Dumbledore thinks that -- what was it ? -- ' to the well - organized mind , death is but the next great adventure .
96806	96816	96818	96818	Ron	194	" I always said he was off his rocker , "
96830	96838	96840	96840	Harry	95	" So what happened to you two ? "
96842	96851	96853	96853	Hermione	219	" Well , I got back all right , "
96855	96914	96853	96853	Hermione	219	" I brought Ron round -- that took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew -- he just said , ' Harry 's gone after him , has n't he ? ' and hurtled off to the third floor . "
96915	96925	96927	96927	Ron	194	" D'you think he meant you to do it ? "
96929	96939	96927	96927	Ron	194	" Sending you your father 's cloak and everything ? "
96940	96943	96944	96944	Hermione	219	" Well , "
96947	96966	96944	96944	Hermione	219	" if he did -- I mean to say that 's terrible -- you could have been killed . "
96967	96974	96976	96976	Harry	95	" No , it is n't , "
96979	97079	96976	96976	Harry	95	" He 's a funny man , Dumbledore . I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance . I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here , you know . I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try , and instead of stopping us , he just taught us enough to help . I do n't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked . It 's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could .... "
97080	97092	97094	97094	Ron	194	" Yeah , Dumbledore 's off his rocker , all right , "
97097	97149	97094	97094	Ron	194	" Listen , you 've got to be up for the end - of - year feast tomorrow . The points are all in and Slytherin won , of course -- you missed the last Quidditch match , we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you -- but the food'll be good . "
97159	97169	97170	97170	she	114	" You 've had nearly fifteen minutes , now OUT "
97196	97216	97188	97188	I	0	" he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes . I can , ca n't I ? "
97217	97229	97230	97230	she	114	" Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go , "
97250	97257	97230	97230	she	114	" And you have another visitor . "
97258	97263	97265	97265	Harry	95	" Oh , good , "
97267	97272	97265	97265	Harry	95	" Who is it ? "
97315	97327	97328	97328	he	282	" It 's -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault ! "
97399	97399	97396	97397	a Muggle	448	"
97400	97403	97405	97405	Harry	282	" Hagrid ! "
97425	97456	97422	97422	his	282	" Hagrid , he 'd have found out somehow , this is Voldemort we 're talking about , he 'd have found out even if you had n't told him . "
97457	97463	97465	97465	Hagrid	282	" Yeh could 've died ! "
97467	97476	97465	97465	Hagrid	282	" An ' don ' say the name ! "
97477	97480	97481	97481	Harry	282	" VOLDEMORT ! "
97494	97539	97490	97490	he	282	" I 've met him and I 'm calling him by his name . Please cheer up , Hagrid , we saved the Stone , it 's gone , he ca n't use it . Have a Chocolate Frog , I 've got loads .... "
97553	97565	97540	97540	Hagrid	282	" That reminds me . I 've got yeh a present . "
97566	97577	97579	97579	Harry	282	" It 's not a stoat sandwich , is it ? "
97591	97620	97585	97585	Hagrid	282	" Nah . Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it . ' Course , he shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway , got yeh this ... "
97659	97688	97657	97657	father	546	" Sent owls off ter all yer parents ' old school friends , askin ' fer photos ... knew yeh didn ' have any ... d'yeh like it ? "
97846	97851	97852	97852	Dumbledore	118	" Another year gone ! "
97856	97914	97852	97852	Dumbledore	118	" And I must trouble you with an old man 's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast . What a year it has been ! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were ... you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts ....
97915	97979	97852	97852	Dumbledore	118	" Now , as I understand it , the house cup here needs awarding , and the points stand thus : In fourth place , Gryffindor , with three hundred and twelve points ; in third , Hufflepuff , with three hundred and fifty - two ; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty - six and Slytherin , four hundred and seventy- two . "
