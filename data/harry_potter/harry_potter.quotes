1089	1108	1085	1085	they	417	" The Potters , that 's right , that 's what I heard yes , their son , Harry "
1343	1346	1347	1347	he	93	" Sorry , "
1416	1460	1405	1405	he	435	" Do n't be sorry , my dear sir , for nothing could upset me today ! Rejoice , for You - Know - Who has gone at last ! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating , this happy , happy day ! "
1603	1606	1608	1609	Mr. Dursley	93	" Shoo ! "
1695	1699	1671	1671	She	92	" Wo n't ! "
1735	1802	1803	1804	The newscaster	448	" And finally , bird - watchers everywhere have reported that the nation 's owls have been behaving very unusually today . Although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight , there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise . Experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern . "
1810	1837	1806	1806	himself	448	" Most mysterious . And now , over to Jim McGuffin with the weather . Going to be any more showers of owls tonight , Jim ? "
1838	1843	1845	1846	the weatherman	449	" Well , Ted , "
1848	1933	1845	1846	the weatherman	449	" I do n't know about that , but it 's not only the owls that have been acting oddly today . Viewers as far apart as Kent , Yorkshire , and Dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain I promised yesterday , they 've had a downpour of shooting stars ! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early -- it 's not until next week , folks ! But I can promise a wet night tonight . "
2005	2024	2001	2001	his	93	" Er -- Petunia , dear -- you have n't heard from your sister lately , have you ? "
2050	2053	2054	2054	she	92	" No , "
2058	2061	2054	2054	she	92	" Why ? "
2062	2069	2070	2071	Mr. Dursley	93	" Funny stuff on the news , "
2074	2094	2070	2071	Mr. Dursley	93	" Owls ... shooting stars ... and there were a lot of funny - looking people in town today ... "
2095	2098	2100	2101	Mrs. Dursley	92	" So ? "
2103	2125	2070	2071	Mr. Dursley	93	" Well , I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to do with ... you know ... her crowd . "
2148	2151	2139	2139	he	93	" Potter . "
2169	2186	2160	2160	he	93	" Their son -- he 'd be about Dudley 's age now , would n't he ? "
2187	2192	2194	2195	Mrs. Dursley	92	" I suppose so , "
2198	2211	2160	2160	he	93	" What 's his name again ? Howard , is n't it ? "
2212	2225	2160	2160	he	93	" Harry . Nasty , common name , if you ask me . "
2226	2231	2233	2234	Mr. Dursley	93	" Oh , yes , "
2241	2248	2233	2234	Mr. Dursley	93	" Yes , I quite agree . "
2783	2789	2778	2778	He	105	" I should have known . "
2966	2975	2961	2961	he	105	" Fancy seeing you here , Professor McGonagall . "
3047	3056	3057	3057	she	475	" How did you know it was me ? "
3060	3076	3042	3042	She	475	" My dear Professor , I ' ve never seen a cat sit so stiffly . "
3077	3094	3096	3097	Professor McGonagall	106	" You 'd be stiff if you 'd been sitting on a brick wall all day , "
3099	3124	3042	3042	She	475	" All day ? When you could have been celebrating ? I must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here . "
3130	3141	3142	3142	she	475	" Oh yes , everyone 's celebrating , all right , "
3146	3177	3178	3178	She	475	" You 'd think they 'd be a bit more careful , but no -- even the Muggles have noticed something 's going on . It was on their news . "
3193	3240	3178	3178	She	475	" I heard it . Flocks of owls ... shooting stars .... Well , they 're not completely stupid . They were bound to notice something . Shooting stars down in Kent -- I 'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle . He never had much sense . "
3241	3248	3250	3250	Dumbledore	105	" You ca n't blame them , "
3253	3265	3250	3250	Dumbledore	105	" We 've had precious little to celebrate for eleven years . "
3266	3271	3273	3274	Professor McGonagall	106	" I know that , "
3277	3312	3273	3274	Professor McGonagall	106	" But that 's no reason to lose our heads . People are being downright careless , out on the streets in broad daylight , not even dressed in Muggle clothes , swapping rumors . "
3345	3385	3341	3341	she	475	" A fine thing it would be if , on the very day YouKnow - Who seems to have disappeared at last , the Muggles found out about us all . I suppose he really has gone , Dumbledore ? "
3386	3392	3394	3394	Dumbledore	105	" It certainly seems so , "
3396	3413	3394	3394	Dumbledore	105	" We have much to be thankful for . Would you care for a lemon drop ? "
3414	3418	3341	3341	she	475	" A what ? "
3419	3436	3394	3394	Dumbledore	105	" A lemon drop . They 're a kind of Muggle sweet I 'm rather fond of "
3437	3443	3451	3451	she	475	" No , thank you , "
3463	3478	3451	3451	she	475	" As I say , even if You - Know - Who has gone - "
3479	3527	3528	3529	Professor McGonagall	106	" My dear Professor , surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name ? All this ' You- Know - Who ' nonsense -- for eleven years I have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name : Voldemort . "
3547	3579	3533	3533	Dumbledore	105	" It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ' You - Know - Who . ' I have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying Voldemort 's name .
3580	3599	3634	3634	Dumbledore	105	" I know you haven ' t , said Professor McGonagall , sounding half exasperated , half admiring . "
3626	3626	3620	3620	Voldemort	110	"
3627	3632	3634	3634	Dumbledore	105	" You flatter me , "
3637	3646	3634	3634	Dumbledore	105	" Voldemort had powers I will never have . "
3647	3661	3620	3620	Voldemort	110	" Only because you 're too -- well -- noble to use them . "
3662	3687	3634	3634	Dumbledore	105	" It 's lucky it 's dark . I have n't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs . "
3699	3732	3688	3689	Professor McGonagall	106	" The owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around . You know what everyone 's saying ? About why he 's disappeared ? About what finally stopped him ? "
3793	3795	3775	3775	she	478	" everyone "
3828	3834	3835	3835	she	478	" What they 're saying , "
3839	3877	3835	3835	she	478	" is that last night Voldemort turned up in Godric 's Hollow . He went to find the Potters . The rumor is that Lily and James Potter are -- are -- that they 're -- dead . "
3887	3910	3883	3884	Professor McGonagall	106	" Lily and James ... I ca n't believe it ... I did n't want to believe it ... Oh , Albus ... "
3921	3928	3929	3929	he	105	" I know ... I know ... "
3943	4011	3933	3934	Professor McGonagall	106	" That 's not all . They 're saying he tried to kill the Potter 's son , Harry . But -- he could n't . He could n't kill that little boy . No one knows why , or how , but they 're saying that when he could n't kill Harry Potter , Voldemort 's power somehow broke -- and that 's why he 's gone .
4016	4024	4026	4027	Professor McGonagall	106	" It 's -- it 's true ? "
4029	4075	4026	4027	Professor McGonagall	106	" After all he 's done ... all the people he 's killed ... he could n't kill a little boy ? It 's just astounding ... of all the things to stop him ... but how in the name of heaven did Harry survive ? "
4076	4082	4084	4084	Dumbledore	105	" We can only guess , "
4086	4092	4084	4084	Dumbledore	105	" We may never know . "
4173	4195	4163	4163	he	105	" Hagrid 's late . I suppose it was he who told you I 'd be here , by the way ? "
4196	4199	4201	4202	Professor McGonagall	106	" Yes , "
4204	4225	4201	4202	Professor McGonagall	106	" And I do n't suppose you 're going to tell me why you 're here , of all places ? "
4226	4249	4163	4163	he	105	" I 've come to bring Harry to his aunt and uncle . They 're the only family he has left now . "
4250	4266	4268	4269	Professor McGonagall	106	" You do n't mean -- you ca n't mean the people who live here ? "
4281	4339	4268	4269	Professor McGonagall	106	" Dumbledore -- you ca n't . I 've been watching them all day . You could n't find two people who are less like us . And they 've got this son -- I saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street , screaming for sweets . Harry Potter come and live here ! "
4340	4349	4351	4351	Dumbledore	105	" It 's the best place for him , "
4354	4379	4351	4351	Dumbledore	105	" His aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he 's older . I 've written them a letter . "
4380	4384	4386	4387	Professor McGonagall	106	" A letter ? "
4397	4463	4386	4387	Professor McGonagall	106	" Really , Dumbledore , you think you can explain all this in a letter ? These people will never understand him ! He 'll be famous -- a legend -- I would n't be surprised if today was known as Harry Potter day in the future -- there will be books written about Harry -- every child in our world will know his name ! "
4464	4467	4469	4469	Dumbledore	105	" Exactly , "
4484	4538	4469	4469	Dumbledore	105	" It would be enough to turn any boy 's head . Famous before he can walk and talk ! Famous for something he wo n't even remember ! CarA you see how much better off he 'll be , growing up away from all that until he 's ready to take it ? "
4555	4577	4578	4578	She	482	" Yes -- yes , you 're right , of course . But how is the boy getting here , Dumbledore ? "
4595	4601	4585	4585	she	482	" Hagrid 's bringing him . "
4602	4619	4585	4585	she	482	" You think it -- wise -- to trust Hagrid with something as important as this ? "
4628	4631	4620	4620	I	0	" said Dumbledore .
4632	4646	4648	4649	Professor McGonagall	106	" I 'm not saying his heart is n't in the right place , "
4652	4672	4648	4649	Professor McGonagall	106	" but you ca n't pretend he 's not careless . He does tend to -- what was that ? "
4833	4836	4838	4838	Dumbledore	105	" Hagrid , "
4843	4855	4838	4838	Dumbledore	105	" At last . And where did you get that motorcycle ? "
4856	4865	4867	4868	the giant	491	" Borrowed it , Professor Dumbledore , sit , "
4879	4895	4867	4868	the giant	491	" Young Sirius Black lent it to me . I 've got him , sir . "
4896	4903	4876	4876	he	491	" No problems , were there ? "
4904	4940	4867	4868	the giant	491	" No , sir -- house was almost destroyed , but I got him out all right before the Muggles started swarmin ' around . He fell asleep as we was flyin ' over Bristol . "
4991	4997	4999	5000	Professor McGonagall	106	" Is that where - ? "
5002	5005	5007	5007	Dumbledore	105	" Yes , "
5009	5017	5007	5007	Dumbledore	105	" He 'll have that scar forever . "
5018	5029	5080	5080	Dumbledore	105	" Could n't you do something about it , Dumbledore ? "
5030	5079	5007	5007	Dumbledore	105	" Even if I could , I would n't . Scars can come in handy . I have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the London Underground . Well- give him here , Hagrid -- we 'd better get this over with . "
5094	5109	5111	5111	Hagrid	284	" Could I -- could I say good - bye to him , sir ? "
5150	5153	5155	5156	Professor McGonagall	106	" Shhh ! "
5158	5165	5155	5156	Professor McGonagall	106	" you 'll wake the Muggles ! "
5166	5173	5175	5175	Hagrid	284	" S - s - sorry , "
5191	5218	5175	5175	Hagrid	284	" But I c - c - can't stand it -- Lily an ' James dead- an ' poor little Harry off ter live with Muggles - "
5219	5245	5246	5247	Professor McGonagall	106	" Yes , yes , it 's all very sad , but get a grip on yourself , Hagrid , or we 'll be found , "
5346	5349	5351	5351	Dumbledore	105	" Well , "
5354	5376	5351	5351	Dumbledore	105	" that 's that . We 've no business staying here . We may as well go and join the celebrations . "
5377	5380	5382	5382	Hagrid	284	" Yeah , "
5389	5410	5382	5382	Hagrid	284	" I 'll be takin ' Sirius his bike back . G'night , Professor McGonagall -- Professor Dumbledore , sir . "
5447	5460	5462	5462	Dumbledore	115	" I shall see you soon , I expect , Professor McGonagall , "
5557	5563	5564	5564	he	115	" Good luck , Harry , "
5730	5740	5722	5722	their	509	" To Harry Potter -- the boy who lived ! "
5965	5973	5953	5953	her	103	" Up ! Get up ! Now ! "
5988	5991	5992	5992	she	2393	" Up ! "
6069	6075	6076	6076	she	2393	" Are you up yet ? "
6079	6082	6084	6084	Harry	98	" Nearly , "
6086	6121	6061	6062	His aunt	2393	" Well , get a move on , I want you to look after the bacon . And do n't you dare let it burn , I want everything perfect on Duddy 's birthday . "
6125	6131	6132	6133	his aunt	2393	" What did you say ? "
6139	6144	6132	6133	his aunt	2393	" Nothing , nothing ... "
6477	6487	6488	6488	she	103	" In the car crash when your parents died , "
6492	6499	6488	6488	she	103	" And do n't ask questions . "
6531	6536	6537	6537	he	119	" Comb your hair ! "
6720	6725	6726	6726	he	95	" Thirty - six , "
6737	6746	6726	6726	he	95	" That 's two less than last year . "
6747	6773	6716	6716	His	95	" Darling , you have n't counted Auntie Marge 's present , see , it 's here under this big one from Mommy and Daddy . "
6774	6783	6785	6785	Dudley	95	" All right , thirty - seven then , "
6835	6864	6831	6831	she	103	" And we 'll buy you another two presents while we 're out today . How 's that , popkin ? Two more presents . Is that all right ''
6882	6891	6878	6878	he	95	" So I 'll have thirty ... thirty ... "
6892	6899	6901	6902	Aunt Petunia	103	" Thirty - nine , sweetums , "
6904	6907	6908	6908	Dudley	95	" Oh . "
6918	6923	6908	6908	Dudley	95	" All right then . "
6928	6948	6949	6949	He	119	" Little tyke wants his money 's worth , just like his father . ' Atta boy , Dudley ! "
7021	7027	7028	7028	she	103	" Bad news , Vernon , "
7031	7045	7046	7046	She	103	" Mrs. Figg 's broken her leg . She ca n't take him . "
7150	7154	7156	7157	Aunt Petunia	103	" Now what ? "
7217	7223	7224	7225	Uncle Vernon	119	" We could phone Marge , "
7228	7241	7242	7243	The Dursleys	94	" Do n't be silly , Vernon , she hates the boy . "
7278	7292	7242	7243	The Dursleys	94	" What about what's - her - name , your friend -- Yvonne ? "
7293	7299	7301	7302	Aunt Petunia	103	" On vacation in Majorca , "
7304	7312	7313	7313	Harry	98	" You could just leave me here , "
7356	7367	7368	7368	she	103	" And come back and find the house in ruins ? "
7371	7380	7382	7382	Harry	98	" I wo n't blow up the house , "
7390	7401	7403	7404	Aunt Petunia	103	" I suppose we could take him to the zoo , "
7407	7416	7403	7404	Aunt Petunia	103	" ... and leave him in the car .... "
7417	7431	7403	7404	Aunt Petunia	103	" That car 's new , he 's not sitting in it alone .... "
7479	7497	7498	7498	she	2402	" Dinky Duddydums , do n't cry , Mummy wo n't let him spoil your special day ! "

7733	7762	7717	7717	he	119	" I 'm warning you now , boy -- any funny business , anything at all -- and you 'll be in that cupboard from now until Christmas . "
7763	7772	7774	7774	Harry	98	" I 'm not going to do anything , "
7776	7778	7774	7774	Harry	98	" honestly ..
7866	7873	7864	7864	she	103	" to hide that horrible scar . "

8291	8298	8283	8283	I	0	" said Harry , remembering suddenly . "
8303	8303	8283	8283	I	0	"

8364	8364	8347	8347	I	0	"
8763	8768	8769	8769	he	95	" Make it move , "
8789	8794	8795	8795	Dudley	95	" Do it again , "

9047	9056	9057	9057	Harry	98	" Where do you come from , anyway ? "
9084	9090	9140	9140	Harry	98	" Was it nice there ? "
9114	9128	9102	9102	Harry	98	" Oh , I see -- so you 've never been to Brazil ? "

10241	10246	10248	10248	Harry	98	" No , thanks , "

10639	10666	10636	10637	Aunt Petunia	103	" I 'm dyeing some of Dudley 's old things gray for you . It 'll look just like everyone else 's when I 've finished . "
10778	10785	10787	10788	Uncle Vernon	119	" Get the mail , Dudley , "
10794	10800	10762	10762	They	666	" Make Harry get it . "

11043	11049	11051	11052	Uncle Vernon	119	" Hurry up , boy ! "
11057	11068	11069	11069	He	119	" What are you doing , checking for letter bombs ? "
11128	11133	11134	11134	he	119	" Marge 's ill , "

11408	11413	11399	11399	he	518	" said Harry furiously , "
11419	11419	11399	11399	he	518	"
11420	11428	11430	11431	Uncle Vernon	119	" Get out , both of you , "

11559	11584	11550	11551	Aunt Petunia	103	" look at the address -- how could they possibly know where he sleeps ? You do n't think they 're watching the house ? "
11585	11595	11597	11598	Uncle Vernon	119	" Watching -- spying -- might be following us , "
11601	11622	11550	11551	Aunt Petunia	103	" But what should we do , Vernon ? Should we write back ? Tell them we do n't want -- "
11639	11642	11643	11643	he	98	" No , "
11647	11674	11643	11643	he	98	" No , we 'll ignore it . If they do n't get an answer ... Yes , that 's best ... we wo n't do anything ....
11675	11678	11623	11623	Harry	98	" But -- "
11679	11708	11643	11643	he	98	" I 'm not having one in the house , Petunia ! Did n't we swear when we took him in we 'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense ? "
11735	11741	11743	11743	Harry	98	" Where 's my letter ? "
11755	11762	11743	11743	Harry	98	" Who 's writing to me ? "
11763	11775	11777	11778	Uncle Vernon	119	" No one . it was addressed to you by mistake , "
11781	11787	11777	11778	Uncle Vernon	119	" I have burned it . "
11788	11795	11797	11797	Harry	98	" It was not a mistake , "
11800	11808	11797	11797	Harry	98	" it had my cupboard on it . "
11809	11812	11814	11815	Uncle Vernon	119	" SILENCE ! "
11847	11890	11827	11827	He	119	" Er -- yes , Harry -- about this cupboard . Your aunt and I have been thinking ... you 're really getting a bit big for it ... we think it might be nice if you moved into Dudley 's second bedroom .
11891	11894	11896	11896	Harry	98	" Why ? "
11898	11904	11906	11907	his uncle	684	" Do n't ask questions ! "
11909	11917	11906	11907	his uncle	684	" Take this stuff upstairs , now . "

12446	12458	12459	12459	he	119	" Go to your cupboard -- I mean , your bedroom , "
12464	12472	12459	12459	he	119	" Dudley -- go -- just go . "
12746	12783	12743	12743	I	0	" he began , but Uncle Vernon was tearing the letters into pieces before his eyes . Uncle Vernon did nt go to work that day . He stayed at home and nailed up the mail slot .
12784	12787	12788	12788	he	119	" See , "
12799	12812	12788	12788	he	119	" if they ca n't deliver them they 'll just give up . "
12813	12824	12743	12743	I	0	" I 'm not sure that 'll work , Vernon . "
12825	12847	12849	12850	Uncle Vernon	119	" Oh , these people 's minds work in strange ways , Petunia , they 're not like you and me , "

13056	13068	13069	13069	Dudley	95	" Who on earth wants to talk to you this badly ? "
13096	13102	13103	13103	he	119	" No post on Sundays , "
13115	13121	13103	13103	he	119	" no damn letters today -- "
13174	13179	13164	13164	Harry	98	" Out ! OUT ! "
13234	13239	13241	13242	Uncle Vernon	119	" That does it , "
13287	13287	13288	13288	He	119	"
13405	13413	13414	13414	he	119	" Shake'em off ... shake 'em off , "
13572	13600	13601	13601	She	743	" ' Scuse me , but is one of you Mr. H. Potter ? Only I got about an ' undred of these at the front desk . "
13645	13651	13653	13654	Uncle Vernon	119	" I 'll take them , "
13679	13769	13653	13654	Uncle Vernon	119	" Aunt Petunia suggested timidly , hours later , but Uncle Vernon did n't seem to hear her . Exactly what he was looking for , none of them knew . He drove them into the middle of a forest , got out , looked around , shook his head , got back in the car , and off they went again . The same thing happened in the middle of a plowed field , halfway across a suspension bridge , and at the top of a multilevel parking garage .
13770	13780	13781	13781	Dudley	95	" Daddy 's gone mad , has n't he ? "
13827	13832	13833	13833	he	95	" It 's Monday , "
13838	13855	13833	13833	he	95	" The Great Humberto 's on tonight . I want to stay somewhere with a television . "
13970	13976	13977	13977	he	119	" Found the perfect place ! "

14040	14046	14048	14049	Uncle Vernon	119	" Storm forecast for tonight ! "
14057	14070	14053	14053	his	119	" And this gentleman 's kindly agreed to lend us his boat ! "
14103	14112	14114	14115	Uncle Vernon	119	" I 've already got us some rations , "
14117	14122	14114	14115	Uncle Vernon	119	" so all aboard ! "
14245	14257	14258	14258	he	119	" Could do with some of those letters now , eh ? "
14684	14690	14691	14691	he	95	" Where 's the cannon ? "
14737	14742	14743	14743	he	119	" Who 's there ? "

15622	15638	15619	15619	he	98	" I 'm sorry , but I still do n't really know who you are . "
15657	15662	15663	15663	he	491	" Call me Hagrid , "

16184	16190	16192	16192	Harry	98	" Kept what from me ? "
16195	16202	16204	16205	Uncle Vernon	119	" STOP ! I FORBID YOU ! "
16217	16229	16231	16231	Hagrid	284	" Ah , go boil yet heads , both of yeh , "
16233	16240	16231	16231	Hagrid	284	" Harry -- yet a wizard . "

16268	16276	16278	16278	Hagrid	284	" A wizard , o ' course , "
16294	16343	16278	16278	Hagrid	284	" an ' a thumpin ' good'un , I 'd say , once yeh've been trained up a bit . With a mum an ' dad like yours , what else would yeh be ? An ' I reckon it 's abou ' time yeh read yer letter . "
16508	16519	16505	16505	he	98	" What does it mean , they await my owl ? "
16520	16529	16531	16531	Hagrid	284	" Gallopin ' Gorgons , that reminds me , "
16690	16695	16697	16697	Hagrid	284	" Where was I ? "
16721	16727	16728	16728	he	119	" He 's not going , "
16734	16748	16749	16749	he	119	" I 'd like ter see a great Muggle like you stop him , "
16752	16756	16758	16758	Harry	98	" A what ? "
16762	16766	16768	16768	Hagrid	284	" A Muggle , "
16770	16805	16768	16768	Hagrid	284	" it 's what we call nonmagic folk like thern . An ' it 's your bad luck you grew up in a family o ' the biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on . "
16806	16823	16825	16826	Uncle Vernon	119	" We swore when we took him in we 'd put a stop to that rubbish , "
16828	16841	16825	16826	Uncle Vernon	119	" swore we 'd stamp it out of him ! Wizard indeed ! "
16842	16846	16848	16848	Harry	98	" You knew ? "
16850	16860	16848	16848	Harry	98	" You knew I 'm a -- a wizard ? "
16861	16864	16866	16867	Aunt Petunia	103	" Knew ! "
16870	16973	16866	16867	Aunt Petunia	103	" Knew ! Of course we knew ! How could you not be , my dratted sister being what she was ? Oh , she got a letter just like that and disappeared off to that - that school - and came home every vacation with her pockets full of frog spawn , turning teacups into rats . I was the only one who saw her for what she was -- a freak ! But for my mother and father , oh no , it was Lily this and Lily that , they were proud of having a witch in the family ! "
17000	17062	16989	16989	she	818	" Then she met that Potter at school and they left and got married and had you , and of course I knew you 'd be just the same , just as strange , just as -- as -- abnormal -- and then , if you please , she went and got herself blown up and we got landed with you ! "
17079	17093	17076	17076	he	98	" Blown up ? You told me they died in a car crash ! "
17094	17098	17100	17100	Hagrid	284	" CAR CRASH ! "
17115	17154	17107	17108	the Dursleys	94	" How could a car crash kill Lily an ' James Potter ? It 's an outrage ! A scandal ! Harry Potter not knowin ' his own story when every kid in our world knows his name ! "
17155	17162	17163	17163	Harry	98	" But why ? What happened ? "
17180	17186	17187	17187	he	284	" I never expected this , "
17197	17260	17187	17187	he	284	" I had no idea , when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin ' hold of yeh , how much yeh did n't know . Ah , Harry , I don ' know if I 'm the right person ter tell yeh -- but someone 3 s got ta -- yeh ca n't go off ter Hogwarts not knowin ' . "
17270	17306	17261	17261	He	284	" Well , it 's best yeh know as much as I can tell yeh -- mind , I ca n't tell yeh everythin ' , it 's a great myst'ry , parts of it .... "
17324	17355	17307	17307	He	284	" It begins , I suppose , with -- with a person called -- but it 's incredible yeh do n't know his name , everyone in our world knows -- "
17356	17359	17307	17307	He	284	" Who ? "
17360	17381	17307	17307	He	284	" Well -- I don ' like sayin ' the name if I can help it . No one does . "
17382	17386	17307	17307	He	284	" Why not ? "
17387	17433	17307	17307	He	284	" Gulpin ' gargoyles , Harry , people are still scared . Blimey , this is difficult . See , there was this wizard who went ... bad . As bad as you could go . Worse . Worse than worse . His name was ... "
17443	17450	17451	17451	Harry	98	" Could you write it down ? "
17454	17465	17466	17466	Hagrid	284	" Nah -can't spell it . All right -- Voldemort . "
17469	17618	17466	17466	Hagrid	284	" Don ' make me say it again . Anyway , this -- this wizard , about twenty years ago now , started lookin ' fer followers . Got 'em , too -- some were afraid , some just wanted a bit o ' his power , 'cause he was gettin ' himself power , all right . Dark days , Harry . Did n't know who ter trust , did n't dare get friendly with strange wizards or witches ... terrible things happened . He was takin ' over . ' Course , some stood up to him -- an ' he killed 'em . Horribly . One o ' the only safe places left was Hogwarts . Reckon Dumbledore 's the only one You - Know - Who was afraid of . Did n't dare try takin ' the school , not jus ' then , anyway .
17619	17689	17307	17307	He	284	" Now , yer mum an ' dad were as good a witch an ' wizard as I ever knew . Head boy an ' girl at Hogwarts in their day ! Suppose the myst'ry is why You - Know - Who never tried to get 'em on his side before ... probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin ' ter do with the Dark Side .
17690	17749	17466	17466	Hagrid	284	" Maybe he thought he could persuade 'em ... maybe he just wanted 'em outta the way . All anyone knows is , he turned up in the village where you was all living , on Halloween ten years ago . You was just a year old . He came ter yer house an ' -- an ' -- "
17771	17774	17775	17775	he	284	" Sorry , "
17778	17803	17775	17775	he	284	" But it 's that sad -- knew yer mum an ' dad , an ' nicer people yeh could n't find -- anyway ... "
17804	17985	17750	17750	Hagrid	284	" You - Know - Who killed 'em . An ' then -- an ' this is the real myst'ry of the thing -- he tried to kill you , too . Wanted ter make a clean job of it , I suppose , or maybe he just liked killin ' by then . But he could n't do it . Never wondered how you got that mark on yer forehead ? That was no ordinary cut . That 's what yeh get when a Powerful , evil curse touches yeh -- took care of yer mum an ' dad an ' yer house , even -- but it did n't work on you , an ' that 's why yer famous , Harry . No one ever lived after he decided ter kill 'em , no one except you , an ' he 'd killed some o ' the best witches an ' wizards of the age -- the McKinnons , the Bones , the Prewetts -- an ' you was only a baby , an ' you lived . "
18054	18074	18048	18048	Hagrid	284	" Took yeh from the ruined house myself , on Dumbledore 's orders . Brought yeh ter this lot ... "
18075	18081	18083	18084	Uncle Vernon	119	" Load of old tosh , "
18121	18130	18131	18131	he	119	" Now , you listen here , boy , "
18134	18213	18131	18131	he	119	" I accept there 's something strange about you , probably nothing a good beating would n't have cured- and as for all this about your parents , well , they were weirdos , no denying it , and the world 's better off without them in my opinion -- asked for all they got , getting mixed up with these wizarding types -- just what I expected , always knew they 'd come to a sticky end -- "
18247	18262	18244	18244	he	284	" I 'm warning you , Dursley -I'm warning you -- one more word ... "
18296	18301	18303	18303	Hagrid	284	" That 's better , "
18339	18357	18548	18548	Hagrid	284	" But what happened to Vol-- , sorry -- I mean , You - Know - Who ? "
18358	18404	18548	18548	Hagrid	284	" Good question , Harry . Disappeared . Vanished . Same night he tried ter kill you . Makes yeh even more famous . That 's the biggest myst'ry , see ... he was gettin ' more an ' more powerful -- why 'd he go ?
18405	18482	18548	18548	Hagrid	284	" Some say he died . Codswallop , in my opinion . Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die . Some say he 's still out there , bidin ' his time , like , but I don ' believe it . People who was on his side came back ter ours . Some of 'em came outta kinda trances . Don~ reckon they could 've done if he was comin ' back .
18483	18547	18548	18548	Hagrid	284	" Most of us reckon he 's still out there somewhere but lost his powers . Too weak to carry on . 'Cause somethin' about you finished him , Harry . There was somethin' goin' on that night he had n't counted on -- I dunno what it was , no one does -- but somethin' about you stumped him , all right . "
18666	18669	18670	18670	he	2507	" Hagrid , "
18674	18694	18670	18670	he	2507	" I think you must have made a mistake . I do n't think I can be a wizard . "
18702	18720	18699	18699	Hagrid	284	" Not a wizard , eh ? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry ? "
18849	18852	18854	18854	Hagrid	284	" See ? "
18856	18875	18854	18854	Hagrid	284	" Harry Potter , not a wizard -- you wait , you 'll be right famous at Hogwarts . "
18889	18900	18901	18901	he	119	" Have n't I told you he 's not going ? "
18904	18938	18901	18901	he	119	" He 's going to Stonewall High and he 'll be grateful for it . I 've read those letters and he needs all sorts of rubbish -- spell books and wands and -- "
18939	18956	18958	18958	Hagrid	284	" If he wants ter go , a great Muggle like you wo n't stop him , "
18960	19041	18958	18958	Hagrid	284	" Stop Lily an ' James Potter ' s son goin' ter Hogwarts ! Yer mad . His name 's been down ever since he was born . He 's off ter the finest school of witchcraft and wizardry in the world . Seven years there and he wo n't know himself . He 'll be with youngsters of his own sort , fer a change , an ' he 'll be under the greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled-- "
19042	19058	19060	19061	Uncle Vernon	119	" I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS ! "
19082	19085	19086	19086	he	284	" NEVER , "
19089	19099	19086	19086	he	284	" - INSULT- ALBUS- DUMBLEDORE- IN- FRONT- OF- ME ! "
19218	19224	19225	19225	he	284	" Shouldn'ta lost me temper , "
19229	19264	19225	19225	he	284	" but it did n't work anyway . Meant ter turn him into a pig , but I suppose he was so much like a pig anyway there was n't much left ter do . "
19277	19291	19292	19292	he	284	" Be grateful if yeh did n't mention that ter anyone at Hogwarts , "
19295	19344	19292	19292	he	284	" I 'm -- er -- not supposed ter do magic , strictly speakin ' . I was allowed ter do a bit ter follow yeh an ' get yer letters to yeh an ' stuff- one o ' the reasons I was so keen ter take on the job
19345	19355	19357	19357	Harry	98	" Why are n't you supposed to do magic ? "
19359	19412	19292	19292	he	284	" Oh , well -- I was at Hogwarts meself but I -- er -- got expelled , ter tell yeh the truth . In me third year . They snapped me wand in half an ' everything . But Dumbledore let me stay on as gamekeeper . Great man , Dumbledore . "
19413	19419	19292	19292	he	284	" Why were you expelled ? "
19420	19435	19437	19437	Hagrid	284	" It 's gettin ' late and we 've got lots ter do tomorrow , "
19440	19456	19437	19437	Hagrid	284	" Got ta get up ter town , get all yer books an ' that . "
19470	19477	19478	19478	he	284	" You can kip under that , "
19481	19508	19478	19478	he	284	" Don ' mind if it wriggles a bit , I think I still got a couple o ' dormice in one o ' the pockets . "
19531	19542	19543	19543	I	0	" It was a dream , he told himself firmly . "
19576	19576	19567	19567	I	0	"
19625	19629	19630	19630	Harry	98	" All right , "
19633	19639	19630	19630	Harry	98	" I 'm getting up . "
19757	19763	19764	19764	Harry	98	" Do n't do that . "
19790	19793	19795	19795	Harry	98	" Hagrid ! "
19798	19802	19795	19795	Harry	98	" There 's an owl
19803	19807	19808	19808	Hagrid	284	" Pay him , "
19814	19817	19808	19808	Hagrid	284	" What ? "
19818	19834	19835	19835	Hagrid	284	" He wants payin ' fer deliverin ' the paper . Look in the pockets . "
19876	19882	19884	19884	Hagrid	284	" Give him five Knuts , "
19887	19890	19835	19835	Hagrid	284	" Knuts ? "
19891	19897	19929	19929	he	98	" The little bronze ones . "
19947	19974	19937	19937	Hagrid	284	" Best be Off , Harry , lots ter do today , got ta get up ter London an ' buy all yer stuff fer school . "
20009	20014	19975	19975	Harry	98	" Um -- Hagrid ? "
20015	20018	20020	20020	Hagrid	284	" Mm ? "
20030	20058	19975	19975	Harry	98	" I have n't got any money -- and you heard Uncle Vernon last night ... he wo n't pay for me to go and learn magic . "
20059	20066	20068	20068	Hagrid	284	" Do n't worry about that , "
20077	20088	20068	20068	Hagrid	284	" D'yeh think yer parents did n't leave yeh anything ? "
20089	20097	19975	19975	Harry	98	" But if their house was destroyed -- "
20098	20152	20068	20068	Hagrid	284	" They didn ' keep their gold in the house , boy ! Nah , first stop fer us is Gringotts . Wizards ' bank . Have a sausage , they 're not bad cold -- an ' I wouldn ' say no teh a bit o ' yer birthday cake , neither . "
20153	20158	19975	19975	Harry	98	" Wizards have banks ? "
20159	20170	20068	20068	Hagrid	284	" Just the one . Gringotts . Run by goblins . "
20181	20184	19975	19975	Harry	98	" Goblins ? "
20185	20253	20254	20254	Hagrid	284	" Yeah -- so yeh'd be mad ter try an ' rob it , I 'll tell yeh that . Never mess with goblins , Harry . Gringotts is the safest place in the world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe -- ' cept maybe Hogwarts . As a matter o ' fact , I got ta visit Gringotts anyway . Fer Dumbledore . Hogwarts business . "
20260	20288	20256	20256	himself	284	" He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him . Fetchin ' you gettin ' things from Gringotts -- knows he can trust me , see .
20289	20299	19975	19975	Harry	98	" Got everythin ' ? Come on , then . "
20344	20351	20352	20352	Harry	98	" How did you get here ? "
20361	20364	20366	20366	Hagrid	284	" Flew , "

20372	20394	20425	20425	Hagrid	284	" Yeah -- but we 'll go back in this . Not s'pposed ter use magic now I 've got yeh . "
20414	20423	20425	20425	Hagrid	284	" Seems a shame ter row , though , "
20435	20459	20425	20425	Hagrid	284	" If I was ter -- er -- speed things up a bit , would yeh mind not mentionin ' it at Hogwarts ? "
20460	20465	20467	20467	Harry	98	" Of course not , "
20500	20512	20513	20513	Harry	98	" Why would you be mad to try and rob Gringotts ? "
20516	20521	20523	20523	Hagrid	284	" Spells -- enchantments , "
20532	20590	20523	20523	Hagrid	284	" They say there 's dragons guardin ' the highsecurity vaults . And then yeh got ta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundreds of miles under London , see . Deep under the Underground . Yeh'd die of hunger tryin ' ter get out , even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands on summat . "
20642	20654	20655	20655	Hagrid	284	" Ministry o ' Magic messin ' things up as usual , "

20688	20735	20686	20686	Hagrid	284	" They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister , 0 ' course , but he 'd never leave Hogwarts , so old Cornelius Fudge got the job . Bungler if ever there was one . So he pelts Dumbledore with owls every morning , askin ' fer advice . "
20736	20746	20671	20671	Harry	98	" But what does a Ministry of Magic do ? "
20747	20775	20686	20686	Hagrid	284	" Well , their main job is to keep it from the Muggles that there 's still witches an ' wizards up an ' down the country . "
20776	20779	20671	20671	Harry	98	" Why ? "
20780	20805	20686	20686	Hagrid	284	" Why ? Blimey , Harry , everyone'd be wantin ' magic solutions to their problems . Nah , we 're best left alone . "
20883	20897	20869	20869	he	284	" See that , Harry ? Things these Muggles dream up , eh ? "

20915	20925	20903	20903	Harry	98	" did you say there are dragons at Gringotts ? "
20926	20933	20935	20935	Hagrid	284	" Well , so they say , "

23940	23983	23984	23984	He	284	" Seventeen silver Sickles to a Galleon and twenty - nine Knuts to a Sickle , it 's easy enough . Right , that should be enough fer a couple o ' terms , we 'll keep the rest safe for yeh . "
23989	24006	23984	23984	He	284	" Vault seven hundred and thirteen now , please , and can we go more slowly ? "
24007	24012	24014	24014	Griphook	174	" One speed only , "
24088	24092	24094	24094	Griphook	174	" Stand back , "
24114	24136	24138	24138	Griphook	174	" If anyone but a Gringotts goblin tried that , they 'd be sucked through the door and trapped in there , "
24140	24153	24154	24154	Harry	98	" How often do you check to see if anyone 's inside ? "
24157	24164	24166	24166	Griphook	174	" About once every ten years , "
24258	24289	24291	24291	Hagrid	284	" Come on , back in this infernal cart , and do n't talk to me on the way back , it 's best if I keep me mouth shut , "
24365	24373	24375	24375	Hagrid	284	" Might as well get yer uniform , "
24387	24417	24418	24418	He	98	" Listen , Harry , would yeh mind if I slipped off fer a pick - me - up in the Leaky Cauldron ? I hate them Gringotts carts . "
24451	24456	24457	24457	she	971	" Hogwarts , clear ? "
24466	24484	24457	24457	she	971	" Got the lot here -- another young man being fitted up just now , in fact . "
24545	24548	24550	24551	the boy	428	" Hello , "
24553	24558	24550	24551	the boy	428	" Hogwarts , too ? "
24559	24562	24564	24564	Harry	98	" Yes , "
24566	24585	24587	24588	the boy	428	" My father 's next door buying my books and mother 's up the street looking at wands , "
24598	24644	24590	24590	He	428	" Then I 'm going to drag them off to took at racing brooms . I do n't see why first years ca n't have their own . I think I 'll bully father into getting me one and I 'll smuggle it in somehow . "
24652	24660	24661	24662	the boy	428	" Have you got your own broom ? "
24666	24669	24671	24671	Harry	98	" No , "
24673	24679	24661	24662	the boy	428	" Play Quidditch at all ? "
24680	24683	24684	24684	Harry	98	" No , "
24696	24734	24661	24662	the boy	428	" I do -- Father says it 's a crime if I 'm not picked to play for my house , and I must say , I agree . Know what house you 'll be in yet ? "
24735	24738	24740	24740	Harry	98	" No , "
24749	24794	24661	24662	the boy	428	" Well , no one really knows until they get there , do they , but I know I 'll be in Slytherin , all our family have been -- imagine being in Hufflepuff , I think I 'd leave , would n't you ? "
24795	24798	24800	24800	Harry	98	" Mmm , "
24812	24821	24823	24824	the boy	428	" I say , look at that man ! "
24856	24861	24863	24863	Harry	98	" That 's Hagrid , "
24874	24880	24863	24863	Harry	98	" He works at Hogwarts . "
24881	24884	24886	24887	the boy	428	" Oh , "
24889	24907	24886	24887	the boy	428	" I 've heard of him . He 's a sort of servant , is n't he ? "
24908	24914	24916	24916	Harry	98	" He 's the gamekeeper , "
24929	24974	24886	24887	the boy	428	" Yes , exactly . I heard he 's a sort of savage -- lives in a hut on the school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk , tries to do magic , and ends up setting fire to his bed . "
24975	24982	24984	24984	Harry	98	" I think he 's brilliant , "
24987	24991	24993	24994	the boy	428	" Do you ? "
25001	25013	24993	24994	the boy	428	" Why is he with you ? Where are your parents ? "
25014	25019	25021	25021	Harry	98	" They 're dead , "
25038	25043	25045	25046	the other	984	" Oh , sorry , "
25055	25066	25045	25046	the other	984	" But they were our kind , were n't they ? "
25067	25082	24993	24994	the boy	428	" They were a witch and wizard , if that 's what you mean . "
25083	25154	25045	25046	the other	984	" I really do n't think they should let the other sort in , do you ? They 're just not the same , they 've never been brought up to know our ways . Some of them have never even heard of Hogwarts until they get the letter , imagine . I think they should keep it in the old wizarding families . What 's your surname , anyway ? "
25165	25174	25161	25162	Madam Malkin	176	" That 's you done , my dear , "
25196	25209	25211	25213	the drawling boy	986	" Well , I 'll see you at Hogwarts , I suppose , "
25238	25243	25245	25245	Hagrid	284	" What 's up ? "
25247	25250	25251	25251	Harry	98	" Nothing , "
25291	25298	25288	25288	he	98	" Hagrid , what 's Quidditch ? "
25299	25319	25288	25288	he	98	" Blimey , Harry , I keep forgettin ' how little yeh know -- not knowin ' about Quidditch ! "
25320	25328	25330	25330	Harry	98	" Do n't make me feel worse , "
25344	25359	25288	25288	he	98	" --and he said people from Muggle families should n't even be allowed in . "
25360	25453	25288	25288	he	98	" Yer not from a Muggle family . If he 'd known who yeh were -- he 's grown up knowin ' yer name if his parents are wizardin ' folk . You saw what everyone in the Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh . Anyway , what does he know about it , some o ' the best I ever saw were the only ones with magic in 'em in a long line 0 ' Muggles -- look at yer mum ! Look what she had fer a sister ! "
25454	25460	25288	25288	he	98	" So what is Quidditch ? "
25461	25505	25288	25288	he	98	" It 's our sport . Wizard sport . It 's like -- like soccer in the Muggle world -- everyone follows Quidditch -- played up in the air on broomsticks and there 's four balls -- sorta hard ter explain the rules . "
25506	25514	25288	25288	he	98	" And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff ? "
25515	25535	25288	25288	he	98	" School houses . There 's four . Everyone says Hufflepuff are a lot o ' duffers , but -- "
25536	25543	25545	25545	Harry	98	" I bet I 'm in Hufflepuff "
25548	25554	25556	25556	Hagrid	284	" Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin , "
25559	25585	25556	25556	Hagrid	284	" There 's not a single witch or wizard who went bad who was n't in Slytherin . You - Know - Who was one . "
25586	25600	25288	25288	he	98	" Vol- , sorry - You - Know - Who was at Hogwarts ? "
25601	25608	25610	25610	Hagrid	284	" Years an ' years ago , "
25736	25748	25780	25780	Hagrid	284	" I was trying to find out how to curse Dudley . "
25749	25778	25780	25780	Hagrid	284	" I 'm not sayin ' that 's not a good idea , but yer not ter use magic in the Muggle world except in very special circumstances , "
25782	25810	25780	25780	Hagrid	284	" An ' anyway , yeh couldn ' work any of them curses yet , yeh'll need a lot more study before yeh get ter that level . "
25824	25831	25811	25811	Hagrid	284	" It says pewter on yer list "
25975	25996	25968	25968	Hagrid	284	" Just yer wand left - A yeah , an ' I still have n't got yeh a birthday present . "
26003	26010	25997	25997	Harry	98	" You do n't have to -- "
26011	26085	25997	25997	Harry	98	" I know I do n't have to . Tell yeh what , I 'll get yer animal . Not a toad , toads went outta fashion years ago , yeh'd be laughed at - an ' I don ' like cats , they make me sneeze . I 'll get yer an owl . All the kids want owls , they 're dead useful , carry yer mail an ' everythin ' . "
26148	26154	26156	26156	Hagrid	284	" Don ' mention it , "
26159	26194	26156	26156	Hagrid	284	" Don ' expect you 've had a lotta presents from them Dursleys . Just Ollivanders left now - only place fer wands , Ollivanders , and yeh got ta have the best wand . "
26354	26358	26390	26392	An old man	1007	" Good afternoon , "
26413	26416	26418	26418	Harry	98	" Hello , "
26421	26425	26427	26428	the man	435	" Ah yes , "
26430	26447	26427	26428	the man	435	" Yes , yes . I thought I 'd be seeing you soon . Harry Potter . "
26454	26496	26427	26428	the man	435	" You have your mother 's eyes . It seems only yesterday she was in here herself , buying her first wand . Ten and a quarter inches long , swishy , made of willow . Nice wand for charm work . "
26518	26568	26497	26498	Mr. Ollivander	186	" Your father , on the other hand , favored a mahogany wand . Eleven inches . Pliable . A little more power and excellent for transfiguration . Well , I say your father favored it -- it 's really the wand that chooses the wizard , of course . "
26595	26601	26588	26588	himself	98	" And that 's where ... "
26619	26633	26634	26634	he	186	" I 'm sorry to say I sold the wand that did it , "
26638	26680	26634	26634	he	186	" Thirteen - and - a - half inches . Yew . Powerful wand , very powerful , and in the wrong hands ... well , if I 'd known what that wand was going out into the world to do .... "
26696	26721	26683	26683	his	186	" Rubeus ! Rubeus Hagrid ! How nice to see you again .... Oak , sixteen inches , rather bendy , was n't it ? "
26722	26730	26732	26732	Hagrid	284	" It was , sir , yes , "
26734	26754	26756	26757	Mr. Ollivander	186	" Good wand , that one . But I suppose they snapped it in half when you got expelled ? "
26762	26772	26774	26774	Hagrid	284	" Er -- yes , they did , yes , "
26780	26790	26791	26791	he	186	" I 've still got the pieces , though , "
26795	26803	26805	26806	Mr. Ollivander	186	" But you do n't use them ? "
26809	26816	26818	26818	Hagrid	284	" Oh , no , sit , "
26834	26837	26839	26840	Mr. Ollivander	186	" Hmmm , "
26848	26859	26860	26860	He	186	" Well , now- Mr. Potter . Let me see . "
26874	26881	26860	26860	He	186	" Which is your wand arm ? "
26882	26893	26895	26895	Harry	98	" Er -- well , I 'm right - handed , "
26897	26907	26908	26908	He	186	" Hold out your arm . That 's it . "
26940	27011	26937	26937	he	186	" Every Ollivander wand has a core of a powerful magical substance , Mr. Potter . We use unicorn hairs , phoenix tail feathers , and the heartstrings of dragons . No two Ollivander wands are the same , just as no two unicorns , dragons , or phoenixes are quite the same . And of course , you will never get such good results with another wizard 's wand . "
27046	27051	27052	27052	he	186	" That will do , "
27067	27099	27052	27052	he	186	" Right then , Mr. Potter . Try this one . Beechwood and dragon heartstring . Nine inches . Nice and flexible . just take it and give it a wave . "
27128	27142	27116	27117	Mr. Ollivander	186	" Maple and phoenix feather . Seven inches . Quite whippy . Try -- "
27165	27194	27162	27163	Mr. Ollivander	186	" No , no -here , ebony and unicorn hair , eight and a half inches , springy . Go on , go on , try it out . "
27245	27290	27206	27207	Mr. Ollivander	186	" Tricky customer , eh ? Not to worry , we 'll find the perfect match here somewhere -- I wonder , now - - yes , why not -- unusual combination -- holly and phoenix feather , eleven inches , nice and supple . "
27356	27383	27352	27353	Mr. Ollivander	186	" Oh , bravo ! Yes , indeed , oh , very good . Well , well , well ... how curious ... how very curious ... "
27403	27407	27384	27384	He	186	" Curious ... curious ..
27408	27411	27413	27413	Harry	98	" Sorry , "
27415	27421	27413	27413	Harry	98	" but what 's curious ? "
27431	27495	27427	27427	his	186	" I remember every wand I 've ever sold , Mr. Potter . Every single wand . It so happens that the phoenix whose tail feather is in your wand , gave another feather -- just one other . It is very curious indeed that you should be destined for this wand when its brother why , its brother gave you that scar . "
27499	27565	27427	27427	his	186	" Yes , thirteen - and - a - half inches . Yew . Curious indeed how these things happen . The wand chooses the wizard , remember .... I think we must expect great things from you , Mr. Potter .... After all , He- Who - Must - Not - Be - Named did great things -- terrible , yes , but great . "
27710	27723	27724	27724	he	284	" Got time fer a bite to eat before yer train leaves , "
27755	27766	27768	27768	Hagrid	284	" You all right , Harry ? Yer very quiet , "
27803	27810	27811	27811	he	284	" Everyone thinks I 'm special , "
27816	27884	27811	27811	he	284	" All those people in the Leaky Cauldron , Professor Quirrell , Mr. Ollivander ... but I do n't know anything about magic at all . How can they expect great things ? I 'm famous and I ca n't even remember what I 'm famous for . I do n't know what happened when Vol- , sorry -- I mean , the night my parents died . "
27904	27974	27897	27897	he	284	" Don ' you worry , Harry . You 'll learn fast enough . Everyone starts at the beginning at Hogwarts , you 'll be just fine . just be yerself . I know it 's hard . Yeh've been singled out , an ' that 's always hard . But yeh'll have a great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- still do , ' smatter of fact . "
27997	28003	28004	28004	he	284	" Yer ticket fer Hogwarts , "
28007	28051	28004	28004	he	284	" First o ' September -- King 's Cross- it 's all on yer ticket . Any problems with the Dursleys , send me a letter with yer owl , she 'll know where to find me .... See yeh soon , Harry . "
28381	28387	28373	28373	Dudley	95	" Er -- Uncle Vernon ? "
28397	28416	28388	28389	Uncle Vernon	119	" Er -- I need to be at King 's Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hogwarts . "
28422	28435	28417	28418	Uncle Vernon	119	" Would it be all right if you gave me a lift ? "
28444	28448	28436	28436	Grunt	189	" Thank you . "
28462	28485	28417	28418	Uncle Vernon	119	" Funny way to get to a wizards ' school , the train . Magic carpets all got punctures , have they ? "
28492	28500	28486	28486	Harry	98	" Where is this school , anyway ? "
28501	28507	28509	28509	Harry	98	" I do n't know , "
28531	28548	28549	28549	he	98	" I just take the train from platform nine and three - quarters at eleven o'clock , "
28558	28562	28552	28552	His	98	" Platform what ? "
28563	28570	28555	28555	uncle	2394	" Nine and three - quarters . "
28571	28577	28579	28580	Uncle Vernon	119	" Do n't talk rubbish , "
28582	28593	28579	28580	Uncle Vernon	119	" There is no platform nine and three - quarters . "
28594	28601	28555	28555	uncle	2394	" It 's on my ticket . "
28602	28605	28607	28608	Uncle Vernon	119	" Barking , "
28610	28654	28607	28608	Uncle Vernon	119	" howling mad , the lot of them . You 'll see . You just wait . All right , we 'll take you to King 's Cross . We 're going up to London tomorrow anyway , or I would n't bother . "
28655	28663	28664	28664	Harry	98	" Why are you going to London ? "
28673	28680	28682	28683	Uncle Vernon	119	" Taking Dudley to the hospital , "
28685	28699	28682	28683	Uncle Vernon	119	" Got to have that ruddy tail removed before he goes to Smeltings . "
28878	28916	28875	28875	his	119	" Well , there you are , boy . Platform nine -- platform ten . Your platform should be somewhere in the middle , but they do n't seem to have built it yet , do they ? "
28957	28963	28965	28966	Uncle Vernon	119	" Have a good term , "
29269	29278	29249	29252	a group of people	1058	" -- packed with Muggles , of course -- "
29350	29359	29361	29364	the boys ' mother	1065	" Now , what 's the platform number ? "
29366	29373	29375	29388	a small girl , also red - headed , who was holding her hand	1066	" Nine and three - quarters ! "
29390	29398	29387	29387	her	1066	" Mom , ca n't I go ... "
29399	29421	29375	29388	a small girl , also red - headed , who was holding her hand	1066	" You 're not old enough , Ginny , now be quiet . All right , Percy , you go first . "
29489	29495	29496	29498	the plump woman	1072	" Fred , you next , "
29501	29511	29513	29514	the boy	428	" I 'm not Fred , I 'm George , "
29516	29534	29496	29498	the plump woman	1072	" Honestly , woman , you call yourself our mother ? CarA you tell I 'm George ? "
29535	29542	29496	29498	the plump woman	1072	" Sorry , George , dear . "
29543	29551	29553	29554	the boy	428	" Only joking , I am Fred , "
29626	29630	29631	29631	Harry	98	" Excuse me , "
29638	29643	29644	29644	she	1072	" Hello , dear , "
29647	29659	29644	29644	she	1072	" First time at Hogwarts ? Ron 's new , too . "
29693	29696	29698	29698	Harry	98	" Yes , "
29700	29715	29698	29698	Harry	98	" The thing is -- the thing is , I do n't know how to- "
29716	29724	29725	29725	she	1072	" How to get onto the platform ? "
29733	29738	29739	29739	she	1072	" Not to worry , "
29742	29801	29739	29739	she	1072	" All you have to do is walk straight at the barrier between platforms nine and ten . Do n't stop and do n't be scared you 'll crash into it , that 's very important . Best do it at a bit of a run if you 're nervous . Go on , go now before Ron . "
29802	29807	29809	29809	Harry	98	" Er -- okay , "
30091	30101	30110	30112	the old woman	1094	" Gran , I 've lost my toad again . "
30102	30107	30110	30112	the old woman	1094	" Oh , Neville , "
30126	30137	30122	30124	a small crowd	1096	" Give us a look , Lee , go on . "

30543	30555	30557	30560	one of the twins	1106	" Aaah , has ickle Ronnie got somefink on his nosie ? "
30562	30566	30568	30568	Ron	194	" Shut up , "
30570	30575	30577	30578	their mother	1116	" Where 's Percy ? "
30580	30586	30577	30578	their mother	1116	" He 's coming now . "
30623	30631	30632	30632	he	1067	" Ca n't stay long , Mother , "
30635	30650	30632	30632	he	1067	" I 'm up front , the prefects have got two compartments to themselves -- "
30651	30661	30663	30666	one of the twins	1106	" Oh , are you a prefect , Percy ? "
30675	30687	30663	30666	one of the twins	1106	" You should have said something , we had no idea . "
30688	30702	30704	30706	the other twin	1108	" Hang on , I think I remember him saying something about it , "
30708	30711	30704	30706	the other twin	1108	" Once -- "
30712	30716	30663	30666	one of the twins	1106	" Or twice -- "
30717	30721	30704	30706	the other twin	1108	" A minute -- "
30722	30726	30663	30666	one of the twins	1106	" All summer -- "
30727	30733	30735	30737	Percy the Prefect	201	" Oh , shut up , "
30739	30749	30751	30754	one of the twins	1106	" How come Percy gets new robes , anyway ? "
30756	30763	30765	30766	their mother	1116	" Because he 's a prefect , "
30769	30791	30765	30766	their mother	1116	" All right , dear , well , have a good term -- send me an owl when you get there . "
30809	30841	30803	30803	she	1116	" Now , you two -- this year , you behave yourselves . If I get one more owl telling me you 've -- you 've blown up a toilet or -- "
30842	30856	30803	30803	she	1116	" Blown up a toilet ? We 've never blown up a toilet . "
30857	30866	30803	30803	she	1116	" Great idea though , thanks , Mom . "
30867	30878	30803	30803	she	1116	" It 's not funny . And look after Ron . "
30879	30891	30803	30803	she	1116	" Do n't worry , ickle Ronniekins is safe with us . "
30892	30896	30898	30898	Ron	194	" Shut up , "
30923	30940	30901	30901	He	194	" Hey , Mom , guess what ? Guess who we just met on the train ? "
30953	30974	30941	30941	Harry	98	" You know that black - haired boy who was near us in the station ? Know who he is ? "
30975	30978	30986	30988	the little girl	1131	" Who ? "
30979	30983	30941	30941	Harry	98	" Harry Potter ! "
30992	31012	30986	30988	the little girl	1131	" Oh , Mom , can I go on the train and see him , Mom , eh please .... "
31013	31047	30986	30988	the little girl	1131	" You 've already seen him , Ginny , and the poor boy is n't something you goggle at in a zoo . Is he really , Fred ? How do you know ? "
31048	31064	30986	30988	the little girl	1131	" Asked him . Saw his scar . It 's really there - like lightning . "
31065	31093	30986	30988	the little girl	1131	" Poor dear - no wonder he was alone , I wondered . He was ever so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform . "
31094	31113	30986	30988	the little girl	1131	" Never mind that , do you think he remembers what You - Know - Who looks like ? "
31121	31152	31114	31115	Their mother	1116	" I forbid you to ask him , Fred . No , do n't you dare . As though he needs reminding of that on his first day at school . "
31153	31162	31114	31115	Their mother	1116	" All right , keep your hair on . "
31167	31171	31172	31173	their mother	1116	" Hurry up ! "
31208	31222	31172	31173	their mother	1116	" Do n't , Ginny , we 'll send you loads of owls . "
31223	31233	31192	31192	her	1116	" We 'll send you a Hogwarts toilet seat . "
31234	31237	31172	31173	their mother	1116	" George ! "
31238	31244	31192	31192	her	1116	" Only joking , Mom . "
31355	31360	31361	31361	he	1147	" Anyone sitting there ? "
31371	31377	31361	31361	he	1147	" Everywhere else is full . "
31419	31424	31388	31388	He	1147	" Hey , Ron . "
31430	31453	31425	31426	The twins	1104	" Listen , we 're going down the middle of the train -- Lee Jordan 's got a giant tarantula down there . "
31454	31457	31459	31459	Ron	194	" Right , "
31461	31464	31466	31468	the other twin	1108	" Harry , "
31470	31494	31466	31468	the other twin	1108	" did we introduce ourselves ? Fred and George Weasley . And this is Ron , our brother . See you later , then .
31495	31498	31500	31500	Harry	98	" Bye , "
31514	31521	31522	31522	Ron	194	" Are you really Harry Potter ? "
31529	31546	31548	31548	Ron	194	" Oh -well , I thought it might be one of Fred and George 's jokes , "
31550	31560	31548	31548	Ron	194	" And have you really got -- you know ... "
31582	31591	31579	31579	Ron	194	" So that 's where You - Know - Who
31592	31595	31597	31597	Harry	98	" Yes , "
31599	31607	31597	31597	Harry	98	" but I ca n't remember it . "
31608	31611	31613	31613	Ron	194	" Nothing ? "
31616	31631	31597	31597	Harry	98	" Well -- I remember a lot of green light , but nothing else . "
31632	31635	31637	31637	Ron	194	" Wow , "
31672	31679	31681	31681	Harry	98	" Are all your family wizards ? "
31694	31703	31705	31705	Ron	194	" Er -- Yes , I think so , "
31707	31728	31705	31705	Ron	194	" I think Mom 's got a second cousin who 's an accountant , but we never talk about him . "
31729	31739	31740	31741	The Weasleys	203	" So you must know loads of magic already . "
31760	31770	31772	31772	Ron	194	" I heard you went to live with Muggles , "
31774	31780	31772	31772	Ron	194	" What are they like ? "
31781	31808	31705	31705	Ron	194	" Horrible -well , not all of them . My aunt and uncle and cousin are , though . Wish I 'd had three wizard brothers . "
31809	31812	31814	31814	Ron	194	" Five , "
31825	31957	31820	31820	he	194	" I 'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts . You could say I 've got a lot to live up to . Bill and Charlie have already left -- Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch . Now Percy 's a prefect . Fred and George mess around a lot , but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they 're really funny . Everyone expects me to do as well as the others , but if I do , it 's no big deal , because they did it first . You never get anything new , either , with five brothers . I 've got Bill 's old robes , Charlie 's old wand , and Percy 's old rat . "
31975	32017	31958	31958	Ron	194	" His name 's Scabbers and he 's useless , he hardly ever wakes up . Percy got an owl from my dad for being made a prefect , but they could n't aff- I mean , I got Scabbers instead . "
32108	32132	32080	32080	he	98	" ... and until Hagrid told me , I did n't know anything about be ing a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort "
32136	32139	32141	32141	Harry	98	" What ? "
32143	32154	32156	32156	Ron	194	" You said You - Know - Who 's name ! "
32164	32175	32156	32156	Ron	194	" I 'd have thought you , of all people -- "
32176	32191	32193	32193	Harry	98	" I 'm not trying to be brave or anything , saying the name , "
32218	32237	32215	32215	I	0	" he added , voicing for the first time something that had been worrying him a lot lately , "
32248	32248	32238	32238	I	0	"
32249	32271	32215	32215	I	0	" You wo n't be . There 's loads of people who come from Muggle families and they learn quick enough . "
32340	32348	32328	32332	a smiling , dimpled woman	1159	" Anything off the cart , dears ? "
32520	32526	32503	32503	Harry	98	" Hungry , are you ? "
32527	32530	32532	32532	Harry	98	" Starving , "
32570	32581	32561	32561	He	194	" She always forgets I do n't like corned beef . "
32582	32590	32592	32592	Harry	98	" Swap you for one of these , "
32599	32603	32592	32592	Harry	98	" Go on -- "
32604	32616	32618	32618	Ron	194	" You do n't want this , it 's all dry , "
32620	32628	32629	32629	he	194	" She has n't got much time , "
32633	32642	32629	32629	he	194	" you know , with five of us . "
32643	32651	32653	32653	Harry	98	" Go on , have a pasty , "
32704	32709	32710	32710	Harry	98	" What are these ? "
32722	32732	32712	32712	Ron	194	" They 're not really frogs , are they ? "
32744	32747	32749	32749	Ron	194	" No , "
32751	32764	32749	32749	Ron	194	" But see what the card is . I 'm missing Agrippa . "
32765	32768	32712	32712	Ron	194	" What ? "
32769	32815	32749	32749	Ron	194	" Oh , of course , you would n't know -- Chocolate Frogs have cards , inside them , you know , to collect -- famous witches and wizards . I 've got about five hundred , but I have n't got Agrippa or Ptolemy . "
32866	32872	32874	32874	Harry	98	" So this is Dumbledore ! "
32876	32888	32890	32890	Ron	194	" Do n't tell me you 'd never heard of Dumbledore ! "
32892	32904	32890	32890	Ron	194	" Can I have a frog ? I might get Agrippa -- thanks
32997	33002	32977	32977	Harry	98	" He 's gone ! "
33003	33017	33019	33019	Ron	194	" Well , you ca n't expect him to hang around all day , "
33021	33053	33019	33019	Ron	194	" He 'll be back . No , I 've got Morgana again and I 've got about six of her ... do you want it ? You can start collecting . "
33069	33073	33075	33075	Harry	98	" Help yourself , "
33077	33095	33075	33075	Harry	98	" But in , you know , the Muggle world , people just stay put in photos . "
33096	33109	33110	33110	Ron	194	" Do they ? What , they do n't move at all ? "
33114	33117	33110	33110	Ron	194	" weird ! "
33218	33227	33228	33228	Ron	194	" You want to be careful with those , "
33232	33282	33230	33230	Harry	98	" When they say every flavor , they mean every flavor -- you know , you get all the ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and mar- malade , but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe . George reckons he had a booger- flavored one once . "
33301	33308	33283	33283	Ron	194	" Bleaaargh -- see ? Sprouts . "
33426	33429	33430	33430	he	1179	" Sorry , "
33433	33443	33430	33430	he	1179	" but have you seen a toad at all ? "
33453	33466	33450	33450	he	1179	" I 've lost him ! He keeps getting away from me ! "
33467	33473	33475	33475	Harry	98	" He 'll turn up , "
33477	33480	33482	33483	the boy	428	" Yes , "
33486	33494	33482	33483	the boy	428	" Well , if you see him ... "
33498	33508	33510	33510	Ron	194	" Do n't know why he 's so bothered , "
33512	33542	33510	33510	Ron	194	" If I 'd brought a toad I 'd lose it as quick as I could . Mind you , I brought Scabbers , so I ca n't talk . "
33553	33566	33568	33568	Ron	194	" He might have died and you would n't know the difference , "
33572	33600	33568	33568	Ron	194	" I tried to turn him yellow yesterday to make him more interesting , but the spell did n't work . I 'll show you , look ... "
33631	33639	33640	33640	He	194	" Unicorn hair 's nearly poking out . Anyway
33680	33692	33693	33693	she	1183	" Has anyone seen a toad ? Neville 's lost one , "
33716	33728	33730	33730	Ron	194	" We 've already told him we have n't seen it , "
33749	33764	33739	33739	she	1143	" Oh , are you doing magic ? Let 's see it , then . "
33774	33780	33769	33769	Ron	194	" Er -- all right . "
33786	33802	33783	33783	his	194	" Sunshine , daisies , butter mellow , Turn this stupid , fat rat yellow . "
33819	33829	33831	33832	the girl	1143	" Are you sure that 's a real spell ? "
33834	33946	33831	33832	the girl	1143	" Well , it 's not very good , is it ? I 've tried a few simple spells just for practice and it 's all worked for me . Nobody in my family 's magic at all , it was ever such a surprise when I got my letter , but I was ever so pleased , of course , I mean , it 's the very best school of witchcraft there is , I 've heard -- I 've learned all our course books by heart , of course , I just hope it will be enough -- I 'm Hermione Granger , by the way , who are you .
33981	33987	33988	33988	Ron	194	" I 'm Ron Weasley , "
33991	33995	33997	33997	Harry	98	" Harry Potter , "
33999	34004	34006	34006	Hermione	220	" Are you really ? "
34008	34053	34006	34006	Hermione	220	" I know all about you , of course -- I got a few extra books . for background reading , and you 're in Modern Magical History and The Rise and Fall of the Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events of the Twentieth Century .
34054	34058	34060	34060	Harry	98	" Am I ? "
34065	34086	34088	34088	Hermione	220	" Goodness , did n't you know , I 'd have found out everything I could if it was me , "
34090	34172	34088	34088	Hermione	220	" Do either of you know what house you 'll be in ? I 've been asking around , and I hope I 'm in Gryffindor , it sounds by far the best ; I hear Dumbledore himself was in it , but I suppose Ravenclaw would n't be too bad .... Anyway , we 'd better go and look for Neville 's toad . You two had better change , you know , I expect we 'll be there soon . "
34184	34199	34201	34201	Ron	194	" Whatever house I 'm in , I hope she 's not in it , "
34212	34230	34203	34203	He	194	" Stupid spell -- George gave it to me , bet he knew it was a dud . "
34231	34239	34241	34241	Harry	98	" What house are your brothers in ? "
34243	34246	34248	34248	Ron	194	" Gryffindor , "
34259	34301	34250	34250	Gloom	222	" Mom and Dad were in it , too . I do n't know what they 'll say if I 'm not . I do n't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad , but imagine if they put me in Slytherin . "
34302	34320	34357	34357	Harry	98	" That 's the house Vol- , I mean , You - Know - Who was in ? "
34321	34324	34326	34326	Ron	194	" Yeah , "
34338	34355	34357	34357	Harry	98	" You know , I think the ends of Scabbers ' whiskers are a bit lighter , "
34368	34384	34357	34357	Harry	98	" So what do your oldest brothers do now that they 've left , anyway ? "
34398	34416	34418	34418	Ron	194	" Charlie 's in Romania studying dragons , and Bill 's in Africa doing something for Gringotts , "
34420	34424	34418	34418	Ron	194	" Did you hear about
34457	34457	34448	34448	someone	714	"
34461	34469	34458	34458	Harry	98	" Really ? What happened to them ? "
34470	34541	34542	34542	Harry	98	" Nothing , that 's why it 's such big news . They have n't been caught . My dad says it must 've been a powerful Dark wizard to get round Gringotts , but they do n't think they took anything , that 's what 's odd . ' Course , everyone gets scared when something like this happens in case You - Know - Who 's behind it . "
34590	34592	34542	34542	Harry	98	" Voldemort "
34596	34603	34604	34604	Ron	194	" What 's your Quidditch team ? "
34607	34616	34617	34617	Harry	98	" Er -- I do n't know any , "
34620	34623	34624	34624	Ron	194	" What ! "
34628	34643	34624	34624	Ron	194	" Oh , you wait , it 's the best game in the world -- "
34767	34772	34773	34773	he	194	" Is it true ? "
34776	34800	34773	34773	he	194	" They 're saying all down the train that Harry Potter 's in this compartment . So it 's you , is it ? "
34801	34804	34806	34806	Harry	98	" Yes , "
34840	34851	34853	34855	the pale boy	1203	" Oh , this is Crabbe and this is Goyle , "
34864	34874	34853	34855	the pale boy	1203	" And my name 's Malfoy , Draco Malfoy . "
34895	34934	34935	34935	He	225	" Think my name 's funny , do you ? No need to ask who you are . My father told me all the Weasleys have red hair , freckles , and more children than they can afford . "
34941	34977	34935	34935	He	225	" You 'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others , Potter . You do n't want to go making friends with the wrong sort . I can help you there . "
34995	35011	35012	35012	he	225	" I think I can tell who the wrong sort are for myself , thanks , "
35033	35045	35046	35046	he	225	" I 'd be careful if I were you , Potter , "
35050	35099	35046	35046	he	225	" Unless you 're a bit politer you 'll go the same way as your parents . They did n't know what was good for them , either . You hang around with riffraff like the Weasleys and that Hagrid , and it 'll rub off on you . "
35107	35112	35113	35113	Ron	194	" Say that again , "
35124	35137	35138	35138	Malfoy	225	" Oh , you 're going to fight us , are you ? "
35141	35148	35150	35150	Harry	98	" Unless you get out now , "
35171	35199	35200	35200	Goyle	224	" But we do n't feet like leaving , do we , boys ? We 've eaten all our food and you still seem to have some . "
35314	35321	35322	35322	she	220	" What has been going on ? "
35350	35362	35342	35342	I	0	" Ron said to Harry . He looked closer at Scabbers . "
35377	35377	35371	35371	he	194	"
35383	35390	35342	35342	I	0	" You 've met Malfoy before ? "
35400	35408	35410	35410	Ron	194	" I 've heard of his family , "
35413	35465	35466	35466	He	98	" They were some of the first to come back to our side after You - Know - Who disappeared . Said they 'd been bewitched . My dad does n't believe it . He says Malfoy 's father did n't need an excuse to go over to the Dark Side . "
35471	35479	35466	35466	He	98	" Can we help you with something ? "
35480	35533	35587	35587	Hermione	220	" You 'd better hurry up and put your robes on , I 've just been up to the front to ask the conductor , and he says we 're nearly there . You have n't been fighting , have you ? You 'll be in trouble before we even get there ! "
35534	35543	35545	35545	Ron	194	" Scabbers has been fighting , not us , "
35551	35560	35545	35545	Ron	194	" Would you mind leaving while we change ? "
35561	35585	35587	35587	Hermione	220	" All right -- I only came in here because people outside are behaving very childishly , racing up and down the corridors , "
35593	35611	35587	35587	Hermione	220	" And you 've got dirt on your nose , by the way , did you know ? "
35692	35721	35668	35668	Ron	194	" We will be reaching Hogwarts in five minutes ' time . Please leave your luggage on the train , it will be taken to the school separately . "
35811	35828	35829	35829	Hagrid	284	" Firs ' years ! Firs ' years over here ! All right there , Harry ? "

36006	36014	36015	36015	Hagrid	284	" No more'n four to a boat ! "

36371	36384	36369	36369	Hagrid	284	" Thank you , Hagrid . I will take them from here . "
36517	36522	36524	36525	Professor McGonagall	106	" Welcome to Hogwarts , "
36527	36609	36524	36525	Professor McGonagall	106	" The start - of - term banquet will begin shortly , but before you take your seats in the Great Hall , you will be sorted into your houses . The Sorting is a very important ceremony because , while you are here , your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts . You will have classes with the rest of your house , sleep in your house dormitory , and spend free time in your house common room .
36610	36700	36786	36787	Professor McGonagall	106	" The four houses are called Gryffindor , Hufflepuff , Ravenclaw , and Slytherin . Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards . While you are at Hogwarts , your triumphs will earn your house points , while any rulebreaking will lose house points . At the end of the year , the house with the most points is awarded the house cup , a great honor . I hope each of you will be a credit to whichever house becomes yours .
36701	36738	36739	36739	Her	1260	" The Sorting Ceremony will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school . I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you are waiting . "
36773	36784	36786	36787	Professor McGonagall	106	" I shall return when we are ready for you , "
36789	36794	36786	36787	Professor McGonagall	106	" Please wait quietly . "
36803	36813	36814	36814	he	106	" How exactly do they sort us into houses ? "
36818	36841	36816	36816	Ron	194	" Some sort of test , I think . Fred said it hurts a lot , but I think he was joking . "
37023	37028	37017	37020	several people behind him	1268	" What the -- ? "
37090	37107	37083	37086	a fat little monk	1273	" Forgive and forget , I say , we ought to give him a second chance -- "
37108	37153	37083	37086	a fat little monk	1273	" My dear Friar , have n't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves ? He gives us all a bad name and you know , he 's not really even a ghost -- I say , what are you all doing here ? "
37171	37175	37177	37179	the Fat Friar	1276	" New students ! "
37186	37195	37177	37179	the Fat Friar	1276	" About to be Sorted , I suppose ? "
37202	37210	37212	37213	the Friar	1279	" Hope to see you in Hufflepuff ! "
37215	37223	37212	37213	the Friar	1279	" My old house , you know . "
37224	37229	37212	37213	the Friar	1279	" Move along now , "
37235	37244	37212	37213	the Friar	1279	" The Sorting Ceremony 's about to start . "
37263	37270	37271	37272	Professor McGonagall	106	" Now , form a line , "
37278	37283	37271	37272	Professor McGonagall	106	" and follow me . "
37489	37509	37486	37486	Hermione	220	" Its bewitched to look like the sky outside . I read about it in Hogwarts , A History . "
37670	37680	37630	37630	he	106	" Oh , you may not think I 'm pretty ,

38055	38077	38078	38078	she	1315	" When I call your name , you will put on the hat and sit on the stool to be sorted , "

39375	39379	39419	39419	Percy	191	" Thank you ! "

40065	40074	40076	40076	Seamus	243	" I 'm half - and - half , "
40078	40109	40076	40076	Seamus	243	" Me dad 's a Muggle . Mom did n't tell him she was a witch ' til after they were married . Bit of a nasty shock for him . "
40114	40121	40123	40123	Ron	194	" What about you , Neville ? "
40125	40139	40141	40141	Neville	197	" Well , my gran brought me up and she 's a witch , "
40143	40303	40141	40141	Neville	197	" but the family thought I was all- Muggle for ages . My Great Uncle Algie kept trying to catch me off my guard and force some magic out of me -- he pushed me off the end of Blackpool pier once , I nearly drowned -- but nothing happened until I was eight . Great Uncle Algie came round for dinner , and he was hanging me out of an upstairs window by the ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him a meringue and he accidentally let go . But I bounced -- all the way down the garden and into the road . They were all really pleased , Gran was crying , she was so happy . And you should have seen their faces when I got in here -- they thought I might not be magic enough to come , you see . Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad . "
40319	40361	40310	40311	Percy Weasley	191	" I do hope they start right away , there 's so much to learn , I 'm particularly interested in Transfiguration , you know , turning something into something else , of course , it 's supposed to be very difficult- "
40363	40380	40310	40311	Percy Weasley	191	" You 'll be starting small , just matches into needles and that sort of thing -- "
40480	40483	40484	40484	Harry	106	" Ouch ! "
40492	40497	40499	40499	Percy	191	" What is it ? "
40501	40506	40484	40484	Harry	106	" N - nothing . "
40545	40555	40556	40556	he	106	" Who 's that teacher talking to Professor Quirrell ? "
40560	40615	40537	40537	he	106	" Oh , you know Quirrell already , do you ? No wonder he 's looking so nervous , that 's Professor Snape . He teaches Potions , but he does n't want to -- everyone knows he 's after Quirrell 's job . Knows an awful lot about the Dark Arts , Snape . "
40654	40684	40624	40624	Snape	265	" Ahern -- just a few more words now that we are all fed and watered . I have a few start - of - term notices to give you .
40685	40718	40624	40624	Snape	265	" First years should note that the forest on the grounds is forbidden to all pupils . And a few of our older students would do well to remember that as well . "
40732	40760	40719	40719	Dumbledore	115	" I have also been asked by Mr. Filch , the caretaker , to remind you all that no magic should be used between classes in the corridors .
40761	40787	40624	40624	Snape	265	" Quidditch trials will be held in the second week of the term . Anyone interested in playing for their house teams should contact Madam Hooch .
40788	40828	40719	40719	Dumbledore	115	" And finally , I must tell you that this year , the third - floor corridor on the right - hand side is out of bounds to everyone who does not wish to die a very painful death . "
40842	40848	40849	40849	he	106	" He 's not serious ? "
40854	40858	40860	40860	Percy	191	" Must be , "
40866	40912	40860	40860	Percy	191	" It 's odd , because he usually gives us a reason why we 're not allowed to go somewhere -- the forest 's full of dangerous beasts , everyone knows that . I do think he might have told us prefects , at least . "
40913	40930	40932	40932	Dumbledore	115	" And now , before we go to bed , let us sing the school song ! "
40993	41000	41002	41002	Dumbledore	115	" Everyone pick their favorite tune , "
41004	41010	41002	41002	Dumbledore	115	" and off we go ! "
41016	41024	41002	41002	Dumbledore	115	" Hogwarts , Hogwarts , Hoggy Warty Hogwarts ,
41153	41158	41159	41159	he	115	" Ah , music , "
41166	41184	41159	41159	he	115	" A magic beyond all we do here ! And now , bedtime . Off you trot ! "

41417	41420	41421	41421	he	191	" Oooooooh ! "
41429	41436	41421	41421	he	191	" Ickle Firsties ! What fun ! "
41447	41464	41466	41466	Percy	191	" Go away , Peeves , or the Baron'll hear about this , I mean it ! "
41499	41508	41510	41510	Percy	191	" You want to watch out for Peeves , "
41518	41544	41510	41510	Percy	191	" The Bloody Baron 's the only one who can control him , he wo n't even listen to us prefects . Here we are . "

41909	41912	41947	41947	Whispers	274	" Where ? "
41913	41924	41947	41947	Whispers	274	" Next to the tall kid with the red hair . "
41925	41930	41947	41947	Whispers	274	" Wearing the glasses ? "
41931	41938	41947	41947	Whispers	274	" Did you see his face ? "
41939	41946	41947	41947	Whispers	274	" Did you see his scar ? "
42242	42247	42259	42260	the caretaker	2907	" GOT YOUR CONK ! "
42772	42789	42790	42790	she	1421	" Transfiguration is some of the most complex and dangerous magic you will learn at Hogwarts , "
42793	42812	42790	42790	she	1421	" Anyone messing around in my class will leave and not come back . You have been warned . "
43182	43189	43190	43190	Harry	106	" What have we got today ? "
43201	43208	43210	43210	Ron	194	" Double Potions with the Slytherins , "
43212	43238	43210	43210	Ron	194	" Snape 's Head of Slytherin House . They say he always favors them -- we 'll be able to see if it 's true . "
43239	43245	43247	43247	Harry	106	" Wish McGonagall favored us , "
43636	43641	43642	43642	he	265	" Ah , Yes , "
43646	43655	43642	43642	he	265	" Harry Potter . Our new -- celebrity . "
43711	43726	43727	43727	he	265	" You are here to learn the subtle science and exact art of potionmaking , "
43772	43865	43760	43760	Snape	265	" As there is little foolish wand - waving here , many of you will hardly believe this is magic . I do n't expect you will really understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes , the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins , bewitching the mind , ensnaring the senses .... I can teach you how to bottle fame , brew glory , even stopper death -- if you are n't as big a bunch of dunderheads as I usually have to teach . "
43904	43907	43909	43909	Snape	265	" Potter ! "
43912	43930	43909	43909	Snape	265	" What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood ? "
43963	43971	43973	43973	Harry	98	" I do n't know , sit , "
43983	43994	43995	43995	He	265	" Tut , tut -- fame clearly is n't everything . "
44001	44023	43995	43995	He	265	" Let 's try again . Potter , where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar ? "
44075	44083	44067	44067	Goyle	224	" I do n't know , sit . "
44084	44099	44100	44100	Harry	98	" Thought you would n't open a book before coming , eh , Potter ? "
44148	44161	44139	44139	Snape	265	" What is the difference , Potter , between monkshood and wolfsbane ? "
44177	44183	44185	44185	Harry	98	" I do n't know , "
44188	44203	44185	44185	Harry	98	" I think Hermione does , though , why do n't you try her ? "
44227	44231	44232	44232	he	265	" Sit down , "
44237	44316	44232	44232	he	265	" For your information , Potter , asphodel and wormwood make a sleeping potion so powerful it is known as the Draught of Living Death . A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of a goat and it will save you from most poisons . As for monkshood and wolfsbane , they are the same plant , which also goes by the name of aconite . Well ? Why are n't you all copying that down ? "
44334	44350	44331	44331	Snape	265	" And a point will be taken from Gryffindor House for your cheek , Potter . "
44518	44522	44524	44524	Snape	265	" Idiot boy ! "
44538	44554	44524	44524	Snape	265	" I suppose you added the porcupine quills before taking the cauldron off the fire ? "
44568	44577	44578	44578	Snape	265	" Take him up to the hospital wing , "
44599	44642	44584	44584	he	265	" You -- Potter -- why did n't you tell him not to add the quills ? Thought he 'd make you look good if he got it wrong , did you ? That 's another point you 've lost for Gryffindor . "
44663	44669	44670	44670	he	194	" Doi * push it , "
44673	44683	44670	44670	he	194	" I 've heard Snape can turn very nasty . "
44729	44733	44735	44735	Ron	194	" Cheer up , "
44737	44757	44735	44735	Ron	194	" Snape 's always taking points off Fred and George . Can I come and meet Hagrid with you ? "
44826	44832	44818	44818	Hagrid	284	" Back , Fang- back . "
44850	44854	44855	44855	he	284	" Hang on , "
44858	44863	44855	44855	he	284	" Back , Fang . "
44924	44930	44932	44932	Hagrid	284	" Make yerselves at home , "
44963	44968	44969	44969	Harry	284	" This is Ron , "
44990	44996	44998	44998	Hagrid	284	" Another Weasley , eh ? "
45021	45021	45006	45006	I	0	"
45080	45085	45077	45077	Hagrid	284	" that old git . "
45086	45138	45141	45141	Hagrid	284	" An ' as fer that cat , Mrs. Norris , I 'd like ter introduce her to Fang sometime . D'yeh know , every time I go up ter the school , she follows me everywhere ? Ca n't get rid of her -- Fitch puts her up to it . "
45169	45178	45147	45147	Hagrid	284	" But he seemed to really hate me . "
45179	45182	45184	45184	Hagrid	284	" Rubbish ! "
45186	45191	45184	45184	Hagrid	284	" Why should he ? "
45211	45218	45219	45219	Hagrid	284	" How 's yer brother Charlie ? "
45223	45234	45221	45221	Ron	194	" I liked him a lot -- great with animals . "
45340	45366	45368	45370	a Gringotts spokesgoblin	25	" But we 're not telling you what was in there , so keep your noses out if you know what 's good for you , "
45398	45401	45403	45403	Harry	284	" Hagrid ! "
45405	45426	45403	45403	Harry	284	" that Gringotts break - in happened on my birthday ! It might 've been happening while we were there ! "
45681	45684	45686	45686	Harry	284	" Typical , "
45689	45710	45686	45686	Harry	284	" Just what I always wanted . To make a fool of myself on a broomstick in front of Malfoy . "
45725	45739	45741	45741	Ron	194	" You do n't know that you 'll make a fool of yourself , "
45744	45770	45741	45741	Ron	194	" Anyway , I know Malfoy 's always going on about how good he is at Quidditch , but I bet that 's all talk . "
46173	46179	46180	46180	he	1508	" It 's a Remembrall ! "
46183	46219	46180	46180	he	1508	" Gran knows I forget things -- this tells you if there 's something you 've forgotten to do . Look , you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -- oh ... "
46232	46238	46249	46250	Draco Malfoy	225	" You 've forgotten something ... "
46308	46314	46287	46288	Professor McGonagall	106	" What 's going on ? "
46315	46324	46342	46342	he	225	" Malfoy 's got my Remembrall , Professor . "
46337	46341	46342	46342	he	225	" Just looking , "
46510	46520	46521	46521	she	268	" Well , what are you all waiting for ? "
46524	46537	46521	46521	she	268	" Everyone stand by a broomstick . Come on , hurry up . "
46559	46569	46571	46572	Madam Hooch	268	" Stick out your right hand over your broom , "
46577	46583	46571	46572	Madam Hooch	268	" and say ' Up ! "
46585	46589	46571	46572	Madam Hooch	268	" UPF everyone shouted .
46715	46733	46735	46736	Madam Hooch	268	" Now , when I blow my whistle , you kick off from the ground , hard , "
46738	46767	46735	46736	Madam Hooch	268	" Keep your brooms steady , rise a few feet , and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly . On my whistle -- three- two -- "
46796	46802	46803	46803	she	268	" Come back , boy ! "
46908	46912	46915	46915	her	268	" Broken wrist , "
46918	46933	46915	46915	her	268	" Come on , boy -- it 's all right , up you get . "
46944	46988	46935	46935	She	268	" None of you is to move while I take this boy to the hospital wing ! You leave those brooms where they are or you 'll be out of Hogwarts before you can say ' Quidditch . ' Come on , dear . "
47027	47038	47022	47022	Malfoy	225	" Did you see his face , the great lump ? "
47045	47051	47053	47054	Parvati Patil	248	" Shut up , Malfoy , "
47056	47064	47066	47067	Pansy Parkinson	247	" Ooh , sticking up for Longbottom ? "
47076	47088	47066	47067	Pansy Parkinson	247	" Never thought you 'd like fat little crybabies , Parvati . "
47089	47092	47094	47094	Malfoy	225	" Look ! "
47106	47118	47094	47094	Malfoy	225	" It 's that stupid thing Longbottom 's gran sent him . "
47131	47138	47140	47140	Harry	106	" Give that here , Malfoy , "
47153	47173	47149	47149	Malfoy	225	" I think I 'll leave it somewhere for Longbottom to find -- how about -- up a tree ? "
47174	47179	47180	47180	Harry	106	" Give it here ! "
47217	47225	47214	47214	he	225	" Come and get it , Potter ! "
47231	47234	47236	47237	Hermione Granger	220	" No ! "
47239	47256	47236	47237	Hermione Granger	220	" Madam Hooch told us not to move -- you 'll get us all into trouble . "
47372	47377	47378	47378	Harry	98	" Give it here , "
47381	47391	47378	47378	Harry	98	" or I 'll knock you off that broom ! "
47392	47397	47399	47399	Malfoy	225	" Oh , yeah ? "
47470	47484	47485	47485	Harry	98	" No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save your neck , Malfoy , "
47497	47506	47507	47507	he	98	" Catch it if you can , then ! "
47626	47630	47611	47611	he	98	" HARRY POTTER ! "
47656	47666	47648	47648	He	98	" Never -- in all my time at Hogwarts -- "
47681	47693	47676	47676	her	1534	" -- how dare you -- might have broken your neck -- "
47694	47703	47676	47676	her	1534	" It was n't his fault , Professor -- "
47704	47709	47676	47676	her	1534	" Be quiet , Miss Patil
47710	47714	47676	47676	her	1534	" But Malfoy -- "
47715	47730	47676	47676	her	1534	" That 's enough , Mr. Weasley . Potter , follow me , now . "
47962	47977	47958	47958	her	1534	" Excuse me , Professor Flitwick , could I borrow Wood for a moment ? "
48021	48028	48030	48031	Professor McGonagall	106	" Follow me , you two , "
48047	48051	48041	48041	Wood	292	" In here . "
48076	48081	48082	48082	she	1534	" Out , Peeves ! "
48118	48135	48103	48104	Professor McGonagall	106	" Potter , this is Oliver Wood . Wood -- I 've found you a Seeker . "
48145	48152	48103	48104	Professor McGonagall	106	" Are you serious , Professor ? "
48153	48156	48158	48159	Professor McGonagall	106	" Absolutely , "
48162	48188	48158	48159	Professor McGonagall	106	" The boy 's a natural . I 've never seen anything like it . Was that your first time on a broomstick , Potter ? "
48226	48241	48242	48243	Professor McGonagall	106	" He caught that thing in his hand after a fifty - foot dive , "
48247	48262	48242	48243	Professor McGonagall	106	" Did n't even scratch himself . Charlie Weasley could n't have done it . "
48278	48288	48289	48289	he	292	" Ever seen a game of Quidditch , Potter ? "
48293	48302	48303	48304	Professor McGonagall	106	" Wood 's captain of the Gryffindor team , "
48307	48319	48321	48321	Wood	292	" He 's just the build for a Seeker , too , "
48332	48362	48321	48321	Wood	292	" Light -- speedy -- we 'll have to get him a decent broom , Professor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cleansweep Seven , I 'd say . "
48414	48414	48402	48402	I	0	"
48425	48447	48415	48416	Professor McGonagall	106	" I want to hear you 're training hard , Potter , or I may change my mind about punishing you . "
48453	48461	48462	48462	she	1552	" Your father would have been proud , "
48465	48474	48449	48449	she	1552	" He was an excellent Quidditch player himself . "
48475	48480	48449	48449	she	1552	" You 're joking . "
48526	48529	48530	48530	he	194	" Seeker ? "
48533	48571	48530	48530	he	194	" But first years never -- you must be the youngest house player in about a century , said Harry , shoveling pie into his mouth . He felt particularly hungry after the excitement of the afternoon . "
48576	48576	48572	48572	Wood	292	"
48593	48600	48602	48602	Harry	106	" I start training next week , "
48604	48619	48602	48602	Harry	106	" Only do n't tell anyone , Wood wants to keep it a secret . "
48637	48641	48643	48643	George	193	" Well done , "
48649	48663	48643	48643	George	193	" Wood told us . We 're on the team too -- Beaters . "
48664	48682	48684	48684	Fred	192	" I tell you , we 're going to win that Quidditch cup for sure this year , "
48686	48722	48684	48684	Fred	192	" We have n't won since Charlie left , but this year 's team is going to be brilliant . You must be good , Harry , Wood was almost skipping when he told us . "
48723	48747	48643	48643	George	193	" Anyway , we 've got to go , Lee Jordan reckons he 's found a new secret passageway out of the school . "
48748	48772	48684	48684	Fred	192	" Bet it 's that one behind the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that we found in our first week . See you . "
48795	48814	48684	48684	Fred	192	" Having a last meal , Potter ? When are you getting the train back to the Muggles ? "
48815	48839	48841	48841	Harry	98	" You 're a lot braver now that you 're back on the ground and you 've got your little friends with you , "
48880	48891	48893	48893	Malfoy	225	" I 'd take you on anytime on my own , "
48895	48929	48893	48893	Malfoy	225	" Tonight , if you want . Wizard 's duel . Wands only -- no contact . What 's the matter ? Never heard of a wizard 's duel before , I suppose ? "
48930	48936	48938	48938	Ron	194	" Of course he has , "
48943	48953	48938	48938	Ron	194	" I 'm his second , who 's yours ? "
48965	48968	48969	48969	he	225	" Crabbe , "
48972	48991	48969	48969	he	225	" Midnight all right ? We 'll meet you in the trophy room ; that 's always unlocked . "
49005	49013	49015	49015	Harry	98	" What is a wizard 's duel ? "
49017	49029	49015	49015	Harry	98	" And what do you mean , you 're my second ? "
49030	49044	49046	49046	Ron	194	" Well , a second 's there to take over if you die , "
49070	49124	49066	49066	he	194	" But people only die in proper duels , you know , with real wizards . The most you and Malfoy'll be able to do is send sparks at each other . Neither of you knows enough magic to do any real damage . I bet he expected you to refuse , anyway . "
49125	49137	49066	49066	he	194	" And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens ? "
49138	49149	49150	49150	Ron	194	" Throw it away and punch him on the nose , "
49153	49157	49150	49150	Ron	194	" Excuse me . "
49168	49180	49182	49182	Ron	194	" Ca n't a person eat in peace in this place ? "
49192	49205	49184	49184	Hermione	220	" I could n't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying -- "
49206	49211	49212	49212	Ron	194	" Bet you could , "
49215	49256	49184	49184	Hermione	220	" --and you must n't go wandering around the school at night , think of the points you 'll lose Gryffindor if you 're caught , and you 're bound to be . It 's really very selfish of you . "
49257	49267	49269	49269	Harry	98	" And it 's really none of your business , "
49271	49276	49278	49278	Ron	194	" Good - bye , "
49335	49359	49325	49325	Ron	194	" If he tries to curse you , you 'd better dodge it , because I ca n't remember how to block them . "
49429	49435	49436	49436	Ron	194	" Half - past eleven , "
49441	49447	49436	49436	Ron	194	" we 'd better go . "
49514	49528	49570	49570	Hermione	220	" I ca n't believe you 're going to do this , Harry . "
49547	49550	49552	49552	Ron	194	" You ! "
49555	49561	49552	49552	Ron	194	" Go back to bed ! "
49562	49569	49570	49570	Hermione	220	" I almost told your brother , "
49573	49589	49570	49570	Hermione	220	" Percy -- he 's a prefect , he 'd put a stop to this . "
49600	49604	49605	49605	he	98	" Come on , "
49651	49695	49635	49635	She	220	" Do n't you care about Gryffindor , do you only care about yourselves , I do n't want Slytherin to win the house cup , and you 'll lose all the points I got from Professor McGonagall for knowing about Switching Spells . "
49696	49700	49635	49635	She	220	" Go away . "
49701	49729	49635	49635	She	220	" All right , but I warned you , you just remember what I said when you 're on the train home tomorrow , you 're so -- "
49781	49790	49791	49791	she	220	" Now what am I going to do ? "
49795	49801	49803	49803	Ron	194	" That 's your problem , "
49805	49820	49803	49803	Ron	194	" We 've got to go , we 3 re going to be late . "
49838	49845	49846	49846	she	220	" I 'm coming with you , "
49849	49854	49803	49803	Ron	194	" You are not . "
49855	49902	49803	49803	Ron	194	" D'you think I 'm going to stand out here and wait for Filch to catch me ? If he finds all three of us I 'll tell him the truth , that I was trying to stop you , and you can back me up . "
49903	49910	49912	49912	Ron	194	" You 've got some nerve -- "
49915	49923	49925	49925	Harry	106	" Shut up , both of you ! "
49932	49932	49803	49803	Ron	194	"
49940	49944	49946	49946	Ron	194	" Mrs. Norris ? "
49983	50011	49956	49957	Mrs. Norris	276	" Thank goodness you found me ! I 've been out here for hours , I could n't remember the new password to get in to bed . "
50012	50043	49956	49957	Mrs. Norris	276	" Keep your voice down , Neville . The password 's ' Pig snout ' but it wo n't help you now , the Fat Lady 's gone off somewhere . "
50044	50050	50052	50052	Harry	106	" How 's your arm ? "
50054	50057	50059	50059	Neville	197	" Fine , "
50064	50074	50059	50059	Neville	197	" Madam Pomfrey mended it in about a minute . "
50075	50097	49956	49957	Mrs. Norris	276	" Good - well , look , Neville , we 've got to be somewhere , we 'll see you later -- "
50098	50104	50106	50106	Neville	197	" Do n't leave me ! "
50113	50132	50106	50106	Neville	197	" I do n't want to stay here alone , the Bloody Baron 's been past twice already . "
50147	50179	50133	50133	Ron	194	" If either of you get us caught , I 'll never rest until I 've learned that Curse of the Bogies Quirrell told us about , and used it on you .
50335	50346	50347	50347	Ron	194	" He 's late , maybe he 's chickened out , "
50379	50394	50371	50371	someone	714	" Sniff around , my sweet , they might be lurking in a corner . "
50453	50460	50463	50463	him	275	" They 're in here somewhere , "
50466	50470	50463	50463	him	275	" probably hiding . "
50471	50475	50476	50476	Harry	106	" This way ! "
50552	50555	50556	50556	Harry	106	" RUN ! "
50643	50651	50652	50652	Harry	106	" I think we 've lost him , "
50679	50691	50696	50696	you	106	" Hermione gasped , clutching at the stitch in her chest , "
50698	50698	50692	50692	I	0	"
50699	50710	50712	50712	Ron	194	" We 've got to get back to Gryffindor tower , "
50714	50719	50712	50712	Ron	194	" quickly as possible . "
50720	50725	50726	50726	Hermione	220	" Malfoy tricked you , "
50731	50767	50726	50726	Hermione	220	" You realize that , do n't you ? He was never going to meet you -- Filch knew someone was going to be in the trophy room , Malfoy must have tipped him off . "
50785	50790	50770	50770	she	220	" Let 's go . "
50842	50857	50830	50830	He	231	" Shut up , Peeves -- please -- you 'll get us thrown out . "
50861	50885	50858	50858	Peeves	231	" Wandering around at midnight , Ickle Firsties ? Tut , tut , tut . Naughty , naughty , you 'll get caughty . "
50886	50900	50830	50830	He	231	" Not if you do n't give us away , Peeves , please . "
50901	50909	50911	50911	Peeves	231	" Should tell Filch , I should , "
50923	50934	50918	50918	his	231	" It 's for your own good , you know . "
50935	50942	50944	50944	Ron	194	" Get out of the way , "
50957	50963	50964	50964	Peeves	231	" STUDENTS OUT OF BED ! "
50967	50976	50964	50964	Peeves	231	" STUDENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE CHARMS CORRIDOR "
51006	51011	51012	51012	Ron	194	" This is it ! "
51023	51034	51012	51012	Ron	194	" We 're done for ! This is the end ! "
51052	51058	51059	51059	Hermione	220	" Oh , move over , "
51078	51078	51062	51062	She	220	"
51106	51115	51116	51116	Filch	275	" Which way did they go , Peeves ? "
51120	51126	51116	51116	Filch	275	" Quick , tell me . "
51127	51132	51062	51062	She	220	" Say ' please . "
51134	51149	51116	51116	Filch	275	" Do n't mess with me , Peeves , now where did they go ? "
51150	51162	51164	51164	Peeves	231	" Sha n't say nothing if you do n't say please , "
51171	51176	51166	51166	his	231	" All right -please . "
51177	51202	51209	51209	Peeves	231	" NOTHING ! Ha haaa ! Told you I would n't say nothing if you did n't say please ! Ha ha ! Haaaaaa ! "
51218	51226	51227	51227	Harry	106	" He thinks this door is locked , "
51230	51242	51227	51227	Harry	106	" I think we 'll be okay- get off , Neville ! "
51260	51263	51244	51244	Neville	197	" What ? "
51555	51564	51565	51565	she	1608	" Where on earth have you all been ? "
51583	51594	51596	51596	Harry	106	" Never mind that -- pig snout , pig snout , "
51642	51662	51664	51664	Ron	194	" What do they think they 're doing , keeping a thing like that locked up in a school ? "
51667	51678	51664	51664	Ron	194	" If any dog needs exercise , that one does . "
51692	51707	51708	51708	she	220	" You do n't use your eyes , any of you , do you ? "
51711	51721	51708	51708	she	220	" Did n't you see what it was standing on .
51722	51726	51727	51727	Harry	106	" The floor ? "
51730	51747	51727	51727	Harry	106	" I was n't looking at its feet , I was too busy with its heads . "
51748	51768	51769	51769	She	220	" No , not the floor . It was standing on a trapdoor . It 's obviously guarding something . "
51811	51811	51805	51805	I	0	"
51821	51829	51830	51830	he	194	" No , we do n't mind , "
51833	51845	51830	51830	he	194	" You 'd think we dragged her along , would n't you .
52012	52022	52024	52024	Ron	194	" It 's either really valuable or really dangerous , "
52026	52030	52032	52032	Harry	284	" Or both , "
52343	52349	52350	52350	Ron	194	" A Nimbus Two Thousand ! "
52354	52362	52350	52350	Ron	194	" I 've never even touched one . "
52408	52414	52415	52415	he	225	" That 's a broomstick , "
52434	52453	52415	52415	he	225	" You 'll be in for it this time , Potter , first years are n't allowed them . "
52460	52468	52469	52469	he	194	" It 's not any old broomstick , "
52472	52497	52498	52498	Ron	194	" it 's a Nimbus Two Thousand . What did you say you 've got at home , Malfoy , a Comet Two Sixty ? "
52503	52520	52498	52498	Ron	194	" Comets look flashy , but they 're not in the same league as the Nimbus . "
52521	52539	52540	52540	Malfoy	225	" What would you know about it , Weasley , you could n't afford half the handle , "
52544	52559	52540	52540	Malfoy	225	" I suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig . "
52573	52582	52583	52583	he	281	" Not arguing , I hope , boys ? "
52586	52596	52598	52598	Malfoy	225	" Potter 's been sent a broomstick , Professor , "
52601	52610	52612	52613	Professor Flitwick	281	" Yes , yes , that 's right , "
52619	52638	52612	52613	Professor Flitwick	281	" Professor McGonagall told me all about the special circumstances , Potter . And what model is it ? "
52639	52647	52649	52649	Harry	98	" A Nimbus Two Thousand , sit , "
52665	52680	52681	52681	he	98	" And it 's really thanks to Malfoy here that I 've got it , "
52701	52708	52709	52709	Harry	98	" Well , it 's true , "
52721	52737	52709	52709	Harry	98	" If he had n't stolen Neville 's Remembrall I wouln't be on the team .... "
52738	52752	52762	52762	Hermione	220	" So I suppose you think that 's a reward for breaking rules ? "
52779	52789	52791	52791	Harry	98	" I thought you were n't speaking to us ? "
52793	52801	52803	52803	Ron	194	" Yes , do n't stop now , "
52805	52814	52803	52803	Ron	194	" it 's doing us so much good . "
52902	52905	52906	52906	Ron	194	" Wow , "
53111	53119	53150	53150	his	292	" Hey , Potter , come down ! '
53142	53146	53148	53148	Wood	292	" Very nice , "
53154	53191	53150	53150	his	292	" I see what McGonagall meant ... you really are a natural . I 'm just going to teach you the rules this evening , then you 'll be joining team practice three times a week . "
53205	53208	53210	53210	Wood	292	" Right , "
53212	53247	53210	53210	Wood	292	" Now , Quidditch is easy enough to understand , even if it 's not too easy to play . There are seven players on each side . Three of them are called Chasers . "
53248	53252	53253	53253	Harry	106	" Three Chasers , "
53272	53280	53282	53282	Wood	292	" This ball 's called the Quaffle , "
53284	53324	53282	53282	Wood	292	" The Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal . Ten points every time the Quaffle goes through one of the hoops . Follow me ? "
53325	53340	53341	53341	Harry	106	" The Chasers throw the Quaffle and put it through the hoops to score , "
53344	53363	53341	53341	Harry	106	" So -- that 's sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops , is n't it ? "
53364	53369	53371	53371	Wood	292	" What 's basketball ? "
53374	53378	53380	53380	Harry	106	" Never mind , "
53383	53418	53282	53282	Wood	292	" Now , there 's another player on each side who 's called the Keeper -I'm Keeper for Gryffindor . I have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring . "
53419	53426	53428	53428	Harry	106	" Three Chasers , one Keeper , "
53438	53457	53458	53458	He	292	" And they play with the Quaffle . Okay , got that . So what are they for ? "
53469	53476	53478	53478	Wood	292	" I 'll show you now , "
53480	53484	53478	53478	Wood	292	" Take this . "
53500	53512	53513	53513	Wood	292	" I 'm going to show you what the Bludgers do , "
53516	53523	53513	53513	Wood	292	" These two are the Bludgers . "
53559	53563	53564	53564	Wood	292	" Stand back , "
53648	53651	53652	53652	Wood	292	" See ? "
53669	53729	53652	53652	Wood	292	" The Bludgers rocket around , trying to knock players off their brooms . That 's why you have two Beaters on each team -- the Weasley twins are ours -- it 's their job to protect their side from the Bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team . So- think you 've got all that ? "
53730	53757	53758	53758	Harry	106	" Three Chasers try and score with the Quaffle ; the Keeper guards the goal posts ; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away from their team , "
53762	53766	53768	53768	Wood	292	" Very good , "
53770	53780	53781	53781	Harry	106	" Er -- have the Bludgers ever killed anyone ? "
53789	53817	53785	53785	he	106	" Never at Hogwarts . We 've had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that . Now , the last member of the team is the
53844	53844	53838	53838	they	306	"
53845	53874	53875	53875	Wood	292	" Do n't worry , the Weasleys are more than a match for the Bludgers -- I mean , they 're like a pair of human Bludgers themselves . "
53920	53923	53925	53925	Wood	292	" This , "
53927	54015	53925	53925	Wood	292	" is the Golden Snitch , and it 's the most important ball of the lot . It 's very hard to catch because it 's so fast and difficult to see . It 's the Seeker 's job to catch it . You 've got to weave in and out of the Chasers , Beaters , Bludgers , and Quaffle to get it before the other team 's Seeker , because whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points , so they
54071	54081	54056	54056	they	1652	" Well , that 's it -- any questions ? "
54109	54119	54121	54121	Wood	292	" We wo n't practice with the Snitch yet , "
54131	54153	54121	54121	Wood	292	" it 's too dark , we might lose it . Let 's try you out with a few of these . "
54228	54240	54242	54242	Wood	292	" That Quidditch cup'll have our name on it this year , "
54253	54284	54242	54242	Wood	292	" I would n't be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley , and he could have played for England if he had n't gone off chasing dragons . "
54495	54510	54512	54513	Professor Flitwick	281	" Now , do n't forget that nice wrist movement we 've been practicing ! "
54526	54576	54512	54513	Professor Flitwick	281	" Swish and flick , remember , swish and flick . And saying the magic words properly is very important , too -- never forget Wizard Baruffio , who said 's ' instead of ' f ' and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest . "
54646	54650	54651	54651	he	194	" Wingardium Leviosa ! "
54662	54669	54672	54672	Hermione	220	" You 're saying it wrong , "
54675	54698	54672	54672	Hermione	220	" It 's Wing - gar - dium Levi - o - sa , make the ' gar ' nice and long . "
54699	54712	54713	54713	Ron	194	" You do it , then , if you 're so clever , "
54732	54736	54716	54716	Hermione	220	" Wingardium Leviosa ! "
54752	54758	54760	54761	Professor Flitwick	281	" Oh , well done ! "
54765	54776	54760	54761	Professor Flitwick	281	" Everyone see here , Miss Granger 's done it ! "
54791	54802	54803	54803	he	194	" It 's no wonder no one can stand her , "
54817	54825	54803	54803	he	194	" she 's a nightmare , honestly . "
54859	54866	54854	54854	she	220	" I think she heard you . "
54867	54870	54872	54872	Ron	194	" So ? "
54881	54892	54875	54875	he	194	" She must 've noticed she 's got no friends . "
55075	55088	55060	55060	he	170	" Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought you ought to know . "
55123	55126	55127	55127	he	170	" Prefects , "
55130	55140	55127	55127	he	170	" lead your Houses back to the dormitories immediately ! "
55147	55192	55144	55144	his	191	" Follow me ! Stick together , first years ! No need to fear the troll if you follow my orders ! Stay close behind me , now . Make way , first years coming through ! Excuse me , I 'm a prefect ! "
55193	55201	55202	55202	Harry	106	" How could a troll get in ? "
55210	55224	55226	55226	Ron	194	" Do n't ask me , they 're supposed to be really stupid , "
55228	55239	55226	55226	Ron	194	" Maybe Peeves let it in for a Halloween joke . "
55270	55278	55263	55263	Harry	106	" I 've just thought -- Hermione . "
55279	55284	55263	55263	Harry	106	" What about her ? "
55285	55294	55263	55263	Harry	106	" She does n't know about the troll . "
55300	55306	55307	55307	he	194	" Oh , all right , "
55310	55318	55307	55307	he	194	" But Percy'd better not see us . "
55361	55364	55366	55366	Ron	194	" Percy ! "
55398	55404	55405	55405	Harry	106	" What 's he doing ? "
55408	55424	55405	55405	Harry	106	" Why is n't he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers ? "
55425	55429	55441	55441	Snape	265	" Search me . "
55446	55455	55456	55456	Harry	106	" He 's heading for the third floor , "
55466	55472	55460	55460	Ron	194	" Can you smell something ? "
55664	55671	55672	55672	Harry	106	" The keys in the lock , "
55675	55682	55672	55672	Harry	106	" We could lock it in . "
55683	55687	55689	55689	Ron	194	" Good idea , "
55737	55737	55719	55719	Harry	106	"
55786	55791	55793	55793	Ron	194	" Oh , no , "
55801	55809	55810	55810	Harry	106	" It 's the girls ' bathroom ! "
55813	55816	55817	55817	they	1673	" Hermione ! "
55902	55906	55907	55907	Harry	106	" Confuse it ! "
55978	55985	55987	55987	Ron	194	" Oy , pea - brain ! "
56044	56052	56053	56053	Harry	106	" Come on , run , run ! "
56282	56286	56271	56271	himself	194	" Wingardium Leviosa ! "
56387	56393	56382	56382	Hermione	220	" Is it -- dead ? "
56400	56413	56394	56394	I	0	" said Harry , I think it 's just been knocked out . "
56439	56445	56414	56414	He	106	" Urgh -- troll boogers . "
56592	56601	56610	56610	her	1712	" What on earth were you thinking of ? "
56629	56646	56616	56616	Ron	194	" You 're lucky you were n't killed . Why are n't you in your dormitory ? "
56681	56693	56699	56699	Hermione	220	" Please , Professor McGonagall -- they were looking for me . "
56694	56698	56699	56699	Hermione	220	" Miss Granger ! "
56741	56741	56734	56734	I	0	"
56758	56811	56747	56748	Hermione Granger	220	" If they had n't found me , I 'd be dead now . Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out with its own club . They did n't have time to come and fetch anyone . It was about to finish me off when they arrived . "
56828	56835	56837	56838	Professor McGonagall	106	" Well -- in that case ... "
56847	56868	56837	56838	Professor McGonagall	106	" Miss Granger , you foolish girl , how could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own ? "
56917	56931	56933	56934	Professor McGonagall	106	" Miss Granger , five points will be taken from Gryffindor for this , "
56936	56970	56933	56934	Professor McGonagall	106	" I 'm very disappointed in you . If you 're not hurt at all , you 'd better get off to Gryffindor tower . Students are finishing the feast in their houses . "
56982	57027	56974	56975	Professor McGonagall	106	" Well , I still say you were lucky , but not many first years could have taken on a full - grown mountain troll . You each win Gryffindor five points . Professor Dumbledore will be informed of this . You may go . "
57068	57078	57079	57079	Ron	194	" We should have gotten more than ten points , "
57082	57096	57079	57079	Ron	194	" Five , you mean , once she 's taken off Hermione 's . "
57097	57110	57111	57111	Ron	194	" Good of her to get us out of trouble like that , "
57114	57123	57111	57111	Ron	194	" Mind you , we did save her . "
57124	57142	57143	57143	Harry	106	" She might not have needed saving if we had n't locked the thing in with her , "
57157	57161	57162	57162	they	1718	" Pig snout , "
57220	57223	57217	57217	they	1718	" Thanks , "
57750	57761	57736	57736	he	265	" What 's that you 've got there , Potter ? "
57773	57785	57787	57787	Snape	265	" Library books are not to be taken outside the school , "
57789	57800	57787	57787	Snape	265	" Give it to me . Five points from Gryffindor . "
57801	57810	57811	57811	Harry	98	" He 's just made that rule up , "
57819	57828	57811	57811	Harry	98	" Wonder what 's wrong with his leg ? "
57829	57841	57843	57843	Ron	194	" Dunno , but I hope it 's really hurting him , "
57888	57894	57881	57881	She	220	" How will you learn ? "
57963	57969	57970	57970	they	1741	" Better you than me , "
58077	58082	58083	58083	Snape	265	" Blasted thing * , "
58087	58103	58083	58083	Snape	265	" How are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once ? "
58114	58117	58126	58126	he	265	" POTTER ! "
58139	58151	58136	58136	Harry	98	" I just wondered if I could have my book back . "
58152	58158	58126	58126	he	265	" GET OUT ! OUT ! "
58177	58183	58184	58184	Ron	194	" Did you get it ? "
58191	58197	58187	58187	Harry	98	" What 's the matter ? "
58211	58218	58219	58219	he	98	" You know what this means ? "
58223	58273	58219	58219	he	98	" He tried to get past that three - headed dog at Halloween ! That 's where he was going when we saw him -- he 's after whatever it 's guarding ! And I d bet my broomstick he let that troll in , to make a diversion ! "
58280	58290	58293	58293	he	1747	" No -- he would n't , she said . "
58312	58312	58300	58300	he	1747	"
58313	58327	58329	58329	Ron	194	" Honestly , Hermione , you think all teachers are saints or something , "
58331	58357	58329	58329	Ron	194	" I 'm with Harry . I would n't put anything past Snape . But what 's he after ? What 's that dog guarding ? "
58463	58472	58554	58554	Seamus	243	" You 've got to eat some breakfast . "
58473	58480	58554	58554	Seamus	243	" I do n't want anything . "
58481	58488	58490	58490	Hermione	220	" Just a bit of toast , "
58492	58498	58499	58499	Harry	98	" I 'm not hungry . "
58516	58524	58526	58527	Seamus Finnigan	243	" Harry , you need your strength , "
58529	58543	58526	58527	Seamus Finnigan	243	" Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team . "
58544	58549	58551	58551	Harry	98	" Thanks , Seamus , "
58724	58729	58730	58730	he	292	" Okay , men , "
58733	58737	58739	58741	Chaser Angelina Johnson	315	" And women , "
58743	58747	58748	58748	Wood	292	" And women , "
58751	58756	58748	58748	Wood	292	" This is it . "
58757	58762	58764	58765	Fred Weasley	192	" The big one , "
58767	58777	58779	58779	George	193	" The one we 've all been waiting for , "
58781	58790	58791	58791	Fred	192	" We know Oliver 's speech by heart , "
58795	58804	58791	58791	Fred	192	" we were on the team last year . "
58805	58812	58814	58814	Wood	292	" Shut up , you two , "
58816	58838	58814	58814	Wood	292	" This is the best team Gryffindor 's had in years . We 're going to win . I know it . "
58849	58853	58839	58839	He	292	" Or else . "
58854	58868	58839	58839	He	292	" Right . It 's time . Good luck , all of you . "
58924	58938	58939	58939	she	268	" Now , I want a nice fair game , all of you , "
59016	59023	59039	59039	her	268	" Mount your brooms , please . "
59059	59086	59055	59055	They	1767	" And the Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson of Gryffindor -- what an excellent Chaser that girl is , and rather attractive , too -- "
59087	59090	59039	59039	her	268	" JORDAN ! "
59091	59096	59055	59055	They	1767	" Sorry , Professor . "
59120	59344	59039	59039	her	268	" And she 's really belting along up there , a neat pass to Alicia Spinnet , a good find of Oliver Wood 's , last year only a reserve -- back to Johnson and -- no , the Slytherins have taken the Quaffle , Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains the Quaffle and off he goes -- Flint flying like an eagle up there -- he 's going to sc- no , stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and the Gryffindors take the Quaffle -- that 's Chaser Katie Bell of Gryffindor there , nice dive around Flint , off up the field and -- OUCH -- that must have hurt , hit in the back of the head by a Bludger -- Quaffle taken by the Slytherins -- that 's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward the goal posts , but he 's blocked by a second Bludger -- sent his way by Fred or George Weasley , ca n't tell which -- nice play by the Gryffindor Beater , anyway , and Johnson back in possession of the Quaffle , a clear field ahead and off she goes -- she 's really flying -- dodges a speeding Bludger -- the goal posts are ahead- come on , now , Angelina -- Keeper Bletchley dives -- misses -- GRYFFINDORS SCORE ! "
59360	59368	59357	59358	the Slytherins	261	" Budge up there , move along . "
59369	59372	59373	59373	Ron	194	" Hagrid ! "
59387	59395	59397	59397	Hagrid	284	" Bin watchin ' from me hut , "
59409	59432	59397	59397	Hagrid	284	" But it is n't the same as bein ' in the crowd . No sign of the Snitch yet , eh ? "
59433	59436	59438	59438	Ron	194	" Nope , "
59440	59450	59438	59438	Ron	194	" Harry has n't had much to do yet . "
59451	59462	59464	59464	Hagrid	284	" Kept outta trouble , though , that 's somethin' , "
59511	59525	59526	59526	Wood	317	" Keep out of the way until you catch sight of the Snitch , "
59530	59543	59526	59526	Wood	317	" We do n't want you attacked before you have to be . "
59631	59638	59639	59639	he	284	" All right there , Harry ? "
59655	59660	59661	59662	Lee Jordan	198	" Slytherin in possession , "
59666	59694	59661	59662	Lee Jordan	198	" Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers , two Weasleys , and Chaser Bell , and speeds toward the -- wait a moment -- was that the Snitch ? "
59851	59854	59856	59857	the Gryffindors	260	" Foul ! "
59906	59916	59901	59902	Dean Thomas	168	" Send him off , ref ! Red card ! "
59917	59926	59928	59928	Ron	194	" What are you talking about , Dean ? "
59930	59934	59936	59936	Dean	168	" Red card ! "
59939	59956	59936	59936	Dean	168	" In soccer you get shown the red card and you 're out of the game ! "
59957	59966	59967	59967	Ron	194	" But this is n't soccer , Dean , "
59981	59996	59971	59971	Hagrid	284	" They oughta change the rules . Flint coulda knocked Harry outta the air . "
60008	60018	59997	59998	Lee Jordan	198	" So -- after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating
60019	60022	60024	60025	Professor McGonagall	106	" Jordan ! "
60027	60036	60024	60025	Professor McGonagall	106	" I mean , after that open and revolting foul
60045	60045	60040	60040	I	0	"
60046	60098	60024	60025	Professor McGonagall	106	" All right , all right . Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker , which could happen to anyone , I 'm sure , so a penalty to Gryffindor , taken by Spinner , who puts it away , no trouble , and we continue play , Gryffindor still in possession . "
60270	60310	60265	60265	Lee	198	" Slytherin in possession -- Flint with the Quaffle -- passes Spinnet -- passes Bell -- hit hard in the face by a Bludger , hope it broke his nose- only joking , Professor -- Slytherins score -- A no ...
60349	60358	60359	60359	Hagrid	284	" Dunno what Harry thinks he 's doing , "
60368	60393	60362	60362	He	284	" If I didn ' know better , I 'd say he 'd lost control of his broom ... but he ca n't have .... "
60460	60471	60472	60472	Seamus	243	" Did something happen to it when Flint blocked him ? "
60475	60480	60484	60484	his	284	" Ca n't have , "
60488	60512	60484	60484	his	284	" Ca n't nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful Dark magic -- no kid could do that to a Nimbus Two Thousand . "
60539	60545	60547	60547	Ron	194	" What are you doing ? "
60553	60558	60559	60559	Hermione	220	" I knew it , "
60562	60567	60559	60559	Hermione	220	" Snape -- look . "
60599	60609	60611	60611	Hermione	220	" He 's doing something -- jinxing the broom , "
60613	60619	60596	60596	his	265	" What should we do ? "
60620	60626	60596	60596	his	265	" Leave it to me . "
60744	60750	60751	60751	Ron	194	" Come on , Hermione , "
60909	60916	60917	60917	Ron	194	" Neville , you can look ! "
60978	60985	60986	60986	he	284	" I 've got the Snitch ! "
61003	61015	61016	61016	Flint	180	" He did n't catch it , he nearly swallowed it , "
61086	61091	61092	61092	Ron	194	" It was Snape , "
61096	61120	61092	61092	Ron	194	" Hermione and I saw him . He was cursing your broomstick , muttering , he would n't take his eyes off you . "
61121	61124	61126	61126	Hagrid	284	" Rubbish , "
61146	61155	61126	61126	Hagrid	284	" Why would Snape do somethin' like that ? "
61179	61187	61188	61188	he	284	" I found out something about him , "
61192	61222	61188	61188	he	284	" He tried to get past that three - headed dog on Halloween . It bit him . We think he was trying to steal whatever it 's guarding . "
61228	61236	61237	61237	he	284	" How do you know about Fluffy ? "
61240	61243	61173	61173	Harry	284	" Fluffy ? "
61244	61273	61321	61321	Hagrid	284	" Yeah -- he 's mine -- bought him off a Greek chappie I met in the pub las ' year -- I lent him to Dumbledore to guard the
61274	61277	61279	61279	Harry	284	" Yes ? "
61282	61291	61293	61293	Hagrid	284	" Now , do n't ask me anymore , "
61296	61305	61293	61293	Hagrid	284	" That 's top secret , that is . "
61306	61315	61321	61321	Hagrid	284	" But Snape 's trying to steal it . "
61316	61319	61321	61321	Hagrid	284	" Rubbish , "
61324	61339	61321	61321	Hagrid	284	" Snape 's a Hogwarts teacher , he 'd do nothin' of the sort . "
61340	61351	61353	61353	Hermione	220	" So why did he just try and kill Harry ? "
61407	61407	61403	61403	I	0	"
61408	61418	61420	61420	Hagrid	284	" I 'm tellin ' yeh , yer wrong ! "
61423	61497	61420	61420	Hagrid	284	" I don ' know why Harry 's broom acted like that , but Snape wouldn ' try an ' kill a student ! Now , listen to me , all three of yeh -- yer meddlin ' in things that don ' concern yeh . It 's dangerous . You forget that dog , an ' you forget what it 's guardin ' , that 's between Professor Dumbledore an ' Nicolas Flamel- "
61498	61501	61503	61503	Harry	284	" Aha ! "
61505	61518	61503	61503	Harry	284	" so there 's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved , is there ? "
61683	61690	61692	61693	Draco Malfoy	225	" I do feel so sorry , "
61699	61720	61692	61693	Draco Malfoy	225	" for all those people who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christmas because they 're not wanted at home . "
61973	61982	61983	61983	Ron	194	" Hi , Hagrid , want any help ? "
61993	62005	61987	61987	his	194	" Nah , I 'm all right , thanks , Ron . "
62006	62016	62018	62018	Malfoys	299	" Would you mind moving out of the way ? "
62025	62069	62018	62018	Malfoys	299	" Are you trying to earn some extra money , Weasley ? Hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts , I suppose -- that hut of Hagrid 's must seem like a palace compared to what your family 's used to . "
62082	62085	62076	62076	Snape	265	" WEASLEY ! "
62097	62105	62107	62107	Hagrid	284	" He was provoked , Professor Snape , "
62120	62128	62107	62107	Hagrid	284	" Malfoy was insultin ' his family . "
62129	62144	62146	62146	Snape	265	" Be that as it may , fighting is against Hogwarts rules , Hagrid , "
62149	62172	62146	62146	Snape	265	" Five points from Gryffindor , Weasley , and be grateful it is n't more . Move along , all of you . "
62191	62197	62199	62199	Ron	194	" I 'll get him , "
62209	62220	62199	62199	Ron	194	" one of these days , I 'll get him -- "
62221	62227	62229	62229	Harry	284	" I hate them both , "
62231	62236	62229	62229	Harry	284	" Malfoy and Snape . "
62237	62249	62251	62251	Hagrid	284	" Come on , cheer up , it 's nearly Christmas , "
62253	62272	62251	62251	Hagrid	284	" Tell yeh what , come with me an ' see the Great Hall , looks a treat . "
62302	62321	62376	62376	Hagrid	284	" Ah , Hagrid , the last tree -- put it in the far corner , would you ? "
62364	62375	62376	62376	Hagrid	284	" How many days you got left until yer holidays ? "
62379	62383	62385	62385	Hermione	220	" Just one , "
62387	62412	62385	62385	Hermione	220	" And that reminds me -Harry , Ron , we 've got half an hour before lunch , we should be in the library . "
62413	62421	62423	62423	Ron	194	" Oh yeah , you 're right , "
62454	62458	62460	62460	Hagrid	284	" The library ? "
62469	62482	62460	62460	Hagrid	284	" Just before the holidays ? Bit keen , are n't yeh ? "
62483	62491	62492	62492	Harry	284	" Oh , we 're not working , "
62497	62515	62492	62492	Harry	284	" Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we 've been trying to find out who he is . "
62516	62520	62521	62521	Hagrid	284	" You what ? "
62525	62549	62521	62521	Hagrid	284	" Listen here -- I 've told yeh -- drop it . It 's nothin' to you what that dog 's guardin ' . "
62550	62565	62567	62567	Hermione	220	" We just want to know who Nicolas Flamel is , that 's all , "
62569	62583	62584	62584	Harry	284	" Unless you 'd like to tell us and save us the trouble ? "
62587	62620	62584	62584	Harry	284	" We must 've been through hundreds of books already and we ca n't find him anywhere -- just give us a hint -- I know I 've read his name somewhere . "
62621	62631	62650	62650	Hagrid	284	" I 'm sayin ' nothin , said Hagrid flatly .
62632	62643	62645	62645	Ron	194	" Just have to find out for ourselves , then , "
62906	62915	62925	62926	the librarian	1829	" What are you looking for , boy ? "
62916	62919	62921	62921	Harry	284	" Nothing , "
62934	62948	62925	62926	the librarian	1829	" You 'd better get out , then . Go on -- out ! "
63102	63116	63118	63118	Hermione	220	" You will keep looking while I 'm away , wo n't you ? "
63120	63131	63118	63118	Hermione	220	" And send me an owl if you find anything . "
63132	63146	63148	63148	Ron	194	" And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is , "
63150	63159	63148	63148	Ron	194	" It 'd be safe to ask them . "
63160	63170	63172	63172	Hermione	220	" Very safe , as they 're both dentists , "
63401	63425	63387	63387	they	1840	" Do n't send me there , ca n't you see his knight ? Send him , we can afford to lose him . "
63483	63487	63489	63489	Ron	194	" Merry Christmas , "
63503	63508	63510	63510	Harry	284	" You , too , "
63512	63525	63510	63510	Harry	284	" Will you look at this ? I 've got some presents ! "
63526	63534	63536	63536	Ron	194	" What did you expect , turnips ? "
63643	63648	63650	63650	Harry	284	" That 's friendly , "
63660	63663	63664	63664	he	194	" Weird ! "
63676	63676	63664	63664	he	194	"
63677	63683	63685	63685	Harry	284	" You can keep it , "
63694	63707	63685	63685	Harry	284	" Hagrid and my aunt and uncle -- so who sent these ? "
63708	63719	63721	63721	Ron	194	" I think I know who that one 's from , "
63735	63754	63755	63755	he	194	" My mom . I told her you did n't expect any presents and -- oh , no , "
63758	63767	63755	63755	he	194	" she 's made you a Weasley sweater . "
63794	63803	63805	63805	Ron	194	" Every year she makes us a sweater , "
63811	63818	63805	63805	Ron	194	" and mine 's always maroon . "
63819	63827	63829	63829	Harry	284	" That 's really nice of her , "
63899	63906	63907	63907	he	194	" I 've heard of those , "
63927	63946	63907	63907	he	194	" If that 's what I think it is -- they 're really rare , and really valuable . "
63947	63952	63907	63907	he	194	" What is it ? "
63977	63984	63986	63986	Ron	194	" It 's an invisibility cloak , "
63996	64007	63986	63986	Ron	194	" I 'm sure it is -- try it on . "
64021	64028	64016	64016	Ron	194	" It is ! Look down ! "
64082	64088	64090	64090	Ron	194	" There 's a note ! "
64093	64101	64090	64090	Ron	194	" A note fell out of it ! "
64176	64186	64187	64187	he	194	" I 'd give anything for one of these , "
64190	64198	64187	64187	he	194	" Anything . What 's the matter ? "
64199	64202	64204	64204	Harry	284	" Nothing , "
64270	64274	64292	64292	George	193	" Merry Christmas ! "
64275	64289	64290	64290	Fred	192	" Hey , look -- Harry 's got a Weasley sweater , too ! "
64311	64321	64323	64323	Fred	192	" Harry 's is better than ours , though , "
64331	64345	64323	64323	Fred	192	" She obviously makes more of an effort if you 're not family . "
64346	64356	64357	64357	George	193	" Why are n't you wearing yours , Ron ? "
64360	64374	64357	64357	George	193	" Come on , get it on , they 're lovely and warm . "
64375	64380	64381	64381	Ron	194	" I hate maroon , "
64392	64402	64403	64403	George	193	" You have n't got a letter on yours , "
64406	64433	64403	64403	George	193	" I suppose she thinks you do n't forget your name . But we 're not stupid -- we know we 're called Gred and Forge . "
64434	64441	64477	64477	Fred	192	" What 's all th is noise .
64480	64505	64477	64477	Fred	192	" P for prefect ! Get it on , Percy , come on , we 're all wearing ours , even Harry got one . "
64506	64531	64477	64477	Fred	192	" I -- do n't -- want said Percy thickly , as the twins forced the sweater over his head , knocking his glasses askew .
64532	64545	64547	64547	George	193	" And you 're not sitting with the prefects today , either , "
64549	64557	64547	64547	George	193	" Christmas is a time for family . "
65289	65294	65296	65298	the Fat Lady	1570	" Who 's there ? "
65814	65844	65806	65806	he	106	" You asked me to come directly to you , Professor , if anyone was wandering around at night , and somebody 's been in the library Restricted Section . "
65886	65904	65882	65882	Snape	265	" The Restricted Section ? Well , they ca n't be far , we 'll catch them . "
66545	66548	66549	66549	he	106	" Mom ? "
66552	66555	66549	66549	he	106	" Dad ? "
66740	66746	66727	66727	He	106	" I 'll come back , "
66753	66761	66763	66763	Ron	194	" You could have woken me up , "
66767	66785	66727	66727	He	106	" You can come tonight , I 'm going back , I want to show you the mirror .
66786	66797	66798	66798	Ron	194	" I 'd like to see your mom and dad , "
66802	66829	66727	66727	He	106	" And I want to see all your family , all the Weasleys , you 'll be able to show me your other brothers and everyone . "
66830	66839	66841	66841	Ron	194	" You can see them any old time , "
66843	66882	66841	66841	Ron	194	" Just come round my house this summer . Anyway , maybe it only shows dead people . Shame about not finding Flamel , though . Have some bacon or something , why are n't you eating anything ? "
66937	66943	66945	66945	Ron	194	" Are you all right ? "
66947	66952	66945	66945	Ron	194	" You look odd . "
67011	67016	67018	67018	Ron	194	" I 'm freezing , "
67020	67029	67018	67018	Ron	194	" Let 's forget it and go back . "
67030	67033	67034	67034	Harry	106	" No ! "
67044	67044	67034	67034	Harry	106	"
67085	67095	67096	67096	They	1905	" It 's here -- just here -- yes ! "
67131	67134	67135	67135	Harry	106	" See ? "
67138	67145	67135	67135	Harry	106	" I ca n't see anything . "
67146	67160	67123	67123	father	540	" Look ! Look at them all ... there are loads of them .... "
67161	67168	67135	67135	Harry	106	" I can only see you . "
67169	67183	67123	67123	father	540	" Look in it properly , go on , stand where I am . "
67223	67228	67229	67229	he	106	" Look at me ! "
67232	67243	67212	67212	Ron	194	" Can you see all your family standing around you ? "
67244	67266	67304	67304	Ron	194	" No -- I 'm alone -- but I 'm different -- I look older -- and I 'm head boy ! "
67267	67270	67212	67212	Ron	194	" What ? "
67271	67303	67304	67304	Ron	194	" I am -- I 'm wearing the badge like Bill used to -- and I 'm holding the house cup and the Quidditch cup -- I 'm Quidditch captain , too .
67319	67329	67212	67212	Ron	194	" Do you think this mirror shows the future ? "
67330	67347	67212	67212	Ron	194	" How can it ? All my family are dead -- let me have another look -- "
67348	67365	67212	67212	Ron	194	" You had it to yourself all last night , give me a bit more time . "
67366	67388	67212	67212	Ron	194	" You 're only holding the Quidditch cup , what 's interesting about that ? I want to see my parents . "
67389	67395	67212	67212	Ron	194	" Do n't push me -- "
67421	67424	67416	67416	they	1914	" Quick ! "
67475	67497	67470	67470	she	276	" This is n't safe -- she might have gone for Filch , I bet she heard us . Come on . "
67517	67525	67527	67527	Ron	194	" Want to play chess , Harry ? "
67529	67532	67499	67499	Ron	194	" No . "
67533	67544	67499	67499	Ron	194	" Why do n't we go down and visit Hagrid ? "
67545	67551	67499	67499	Ron	194	" No ... you go ... "
67552	67572	67499	67499	Ron	194	" I know what you 're thinking about , Harry , that mirror . Do n't go back tonight . "
67573	67577	67499	67499	Ron	194	" Why not ? "
67578	67638	67499	67499	Ron	194	" I dunno , I 've just got a bad feeling about it -- and anyway , you 've had too many close shaves already . Filch , Snape , and Mrs. Norris are wandering around . So what if they ca n't see you ? What if they walk into you ? What if you knock something over ? "
67639	67645	67499	67499	Ron	194	" You sound like Hermione . "
67646	67657	67499	67499	Ron	194	" I 'm serious , Harry , do n't go . "
67778	67786	67787	67787	Harry	284	" So -- back again , Harry ? "
67840	67850	67834	67834	he	284	" -- I did n't see you , sir . "
67851	67861	67863	67863	Dumbledore	105	" Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you , "
67876	67879	67881	67881	Dumbledore	105	" So , "
67895	67913	67881	67881	Dumbledore	105	" you , like hundreds before you , have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised . "
67914	67926	67834	67834	he	284	" I did n't know it was called that , Sir . "
67927	67940	67881	67881	Dumbledore	105	" But I expect you 've realized by now what it does ? "
67941	67952	67834	67834	he	284	" It -- well -- it shows me my family -- "
67953	67965	67881	67881	Dumbledore	105	" And it showed your friend Ron himself as head boy . "
67966	67973	67834	67834	he	284	" How did you know -- ? "
67974	67985	67987	67987	Dumbledore	105	" I do n't need a cloak to become invisible , "
67990	68005	67987	67987	Dumbledore	105	" Now , can you think what the Mirror of Erised shows us all ? "
68011	68055	68008	68008	his	284	" Let me explain . The happiest man on earth would be able to use the Mirror of Erised like a normal mirror , that is , he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is . Does that help ? "
68064	68076	68060	68060	he	105	" It shows us what we want ... whatever we want ... "
68077	68082	68084	68084	Dumbledore	105	" Yes and no , "
68087	68187	68084	68084	Dumbledore	105	" It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest , most desperate desire of our hearts . You , who have never known your family , see them standing around you . Ronald Weasley , who has always been overshadowed by his brothers , sees himself standing alone , the best of all of them . However , this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth . Men have wasted away before it , entranced by what they have seen , or been driven mad , not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible .
68188	68262	68263	68263	Harry	284	" The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow , Harry , and I ask you not to go looking for it again . If you ever do run across it , you will now be prepared . It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live , remember that . Now , why do n't you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed ? "
68267	68279	68263	68263	Harry	284	" Sir -- Professor Dumbledore ? Can I ask you something ? "
68280	68289	68290	68290	Dumbledore	115	" Obviously , you 've just done so , "
68293	68304	68290	68290	Dumbledore	115	" You may ask me one more thing , however . "
68305	68317	68263	68263	Harry	284	" What do you see when you look in the mirror ? "
68318	68333	68290	68290	Dumbledore	115	" I ? I see myself holding a pair of thick , woolen socks . "
68337	68345	68347	68347	Dumbledore	115	" One can never have enough socks , "
68349	68373	68347	68347	Dumbledore	115	" Another Christmas has come and gone and I did n't get a single pair . People will insist on giving me books . "
68503	68518	68520	68520	Ron	194	" You see , Dumbledore was right , that mirror could drive you mad , "
68572	68579	68548	68548	She	220	" If Filch had caught you ! "
68798	68805	68806	68806	he	317	" Will you stop messing around ! "
68809	68844	68806	68806	he	317	" That 's exactly the sort of thing that 'll lose us the match ! Snape 's refereeing this time , and he 'll be looking for any excuse to knock points off Gryffindor ! "
68857	68862	68863	68863	he	317	" Snape 's refereeing ? "
68871	68894	68863	68863	he	317	" When 's he ever refereed a Quidditch match ? He 's not going to be fair if we might overtake Slytherin . "
68909	68916	68918	68918	Wood	317	" It 's not my fault , "
68920	68946	68918	68918	Wood	317	" We 've just got to make sure we play a clean game , so Snape has n't got an excuse to pick on us . "
69034	69044	69046	69046	Ron	194	" Do n't talk to me for a moment , "
69055	69061	69062	69062	He	194	" I need to concen -- "
69070	69082	69066	69066	Harry	284	" What 's the matter with you ? You look terrible . "
69111	69116	69118	69118	Hermione	220	" Do n't play , "
69122	69128	69130	69130	Ron	194	" Say you 're ill , "
69132	69139	69140	69140	Hermione	220	" Pretend to break your leg , "
69143	69149	69151	69151	Ron	194	" Really break your leg , "
69153	69158	69160	69160	Harry	284	" I ca n't , "
69162	69182	69160	69160	Harry	284	" There is n't a reserve Seeker . If I back out , Gryffindor ca n't play at all . "
69272	69276	69279	69279	him	197	" What happened ? "
69291	69294	69296	69296	Neville	197	" Malfoy , "
69299	69320	69296	69296	Neville	197	" I met him outside the library . He said he 'd been looking for someone to practice that on . "
69321	69327	69330	69330	Neville	197	" Go to Professor McGonagall ! "
69332	69336	69330	69330	Neville	197	" Report him ! "
69342	69350	69351	69351	he	197	" I do n't want more trouble , "
69354	69366	69368	69368	Ron	194	" You 've got to stand up to him , Neville ! "
69370	69397	69368	69368	Ron	194	" He 's used to walking all over people , but that 's no reason to lie down in front of him and make it easier . "
69398	69422	69423	69423	Neville	197	" There 's no need to tell me I 'm not brave enough to be in Gryffindor , Malfoy 's already done that , "
69470	69478	69479	69479	Harry	106	" You 're worth twelve of Malfoy , "
69482	69504	69479	69479	Harry	106	" The Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor , did n't it ? And where 's Malfoy ? In stinking Slytherin . "
69519	69545	69514	69514	he	197	" Thanks , Harry ... I think I 'll go to bed .... D'you want the card , you collect them , do n't you ? "
69559	69563	69564	69564	he	106	" Dumbledore again , "
69567	69575	69564	69564	he	106	" He was the first one I ever- "
69597	69603	69604	69604	he	106	" I 've found him ! "
69607	69678	69604	69604	he	106	" I 've found Flamel ! I told you I 'd read the name somewhere before , I read it on the train coming here -- listen to this : ' Dumbledore is particularly famous for his defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945 , for the discovery of the twelve uses of dragon 's blood , and his work on alchemy with his partner , Nicolas Flamel ' ! "
69706	69710	69711	69711	she	220	" Stay there ! "
69750	69759	69760	69760	she	220	" I never thought to look in here ! "
69764	69781	69760	69760	she	220	" I got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading . "
69782	69785	69787	69787	Ron	194	" Light ? "
69825	69834	69790	69790	Hermione	220	" I knew it ! I knew it ! "
69835	69843	69845	69845	Ron	194	" Are we allowed to speak yet ? "
69852	69856	69857	69857	she	220	" Nicolas Flamel , "
69861	69873	69857	69857	she	220	" is the only known maker of the Sorcerer 's Stone ! "
69885	69889	69891	69891	Harry	106	" The what ? "
69895	69913	69914	69914	She	220	" Oh , honestly , do n't you two read ? Look -- read that , there . "
70043	70046	70048	70048	Hermione	220	" See ? "
70057	70105	70053	70053	Ron	194	" The dog must be guarding Flamel 's Sorcerer 's Stone ! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep it safe for him , because they 're friends and he knew someone was after it , that 's why he wanted the Stone moved out of Gringotts ! "
70106	70119	70121	70121	Harry	106	" A stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying ! "
70123	70136	70121	70121	Harry	106	" No wonder Snape 's after it ! Anyone would want it . "
70137	70155	70157	70157	Ron	194	" And no wonder we could n't find Flamel in that Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry , "
70159	70178	70157	70157	Ron	194	" He 's not exactly recent if he 's six hundred and sixty - five , is he ? "
70242	70249	70250	70250	he	106	" I 'm going to play , "
70256	70294	70250	70250	he	106	" If I do n't , all the Slytherins will think I 'm just too scared to face Snape . I 'll show them ... it 'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win . "
70295	70309	70311	70311	Hermione	220	" Just as long as we 're not wiping you off the field , "
70634	70646	70647	70647	Hermione	220	" Now , do n't forget , it 's Locomotor Mortis , "
70658	70662	70663	70663	Ron	194	" I know , "
70666	70671	70663	70663	Ron	194	" Do n't nag . "
70684	70720	70678	70678	Wood	317	" Do n't want to pressure you , Potter , but if we ever need an early capture of the Snitch it 's now . Finish the game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much . "
70721	70729	70731	70732	Fred Weasley	192	" The whole school 's out there ! "
70740	70751	70731	70732	Fred Weasley	192	" Even -- blimey -- Dumbledore 's come to watch ! "
70759	70762	70763	70763	he	106	" Dumbledore ? "
70841	70851	70852	70852	he	194	" I 've never seen Snape look so mean , "
70856	70862	70852	70852	he	194	" Look -they're off Ouch ! "
70878	70891	70876	70876	Malfoy	225	" Oh , sorry , Weasley , did n't see you there . "
70900	70926	70892	70892	Malfoy	225	" Wonder how long Potter 's going to stay on his broom this time ? Anyone want a bet ? What about you , Weasley ? "
70981	70995	70997	70997	Malfoy	225	" You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team ? "
71016	71064	71007	71007	Hufflepuff	35	" It 's people they feel sorry for . See , there 's Potter , who 's got no parents , then there 's the Weasleys , who 've got no money -- you should be on the team , Longbottom , you 've got no brains . "
71078	71088	71089	71089	he	197	" I 'm worth twelve of you , Malfoy , "
71118	71125	71103	71103	Ron	194	" You tell him , Neville . "
71126	71146	71092	71092	Malfoy	225	" Longbottom , if brains were gold you 'd be poorer than Weasley , and that 's saying something . "
71162	71172	71103	71103	Ron	194	" I 'm warning you , Malfoy -- one more word
71173	71176	71178	71178	Hermione	220	" Ron ! "
71181	71184	71178	71178	Hermione	220	" Harry -- "
71185	71190	71103	71103	Ron	194	" What ? Where ? "
71230	71248	71250	71250	Malfoy	225	" You 're in luck , Weasley , Potter 's obviously spotted some money on the ground ! "
71289	71295	71296	71296	Hermione	220	" Come on , Harry ! "
71420	71448	71450	71450	Hermione	220	" Ron ! Ron ! Where are you ? The game 's over ! Harry 's won ! We 've won ! Gryffindor is in the lead ! "
71543	71547	71549	71549	Dumbledore	115	" Well done , "
71559	71578	71549	71549	Dumbledore	115	" Nice to see you have n't been brooding about that mirror ... been keeping busy ... excellent ... "
71962	71986	71958	71958	they	1981	" ... d - don't know why you wanted t - t - to meet here of all p - places , Severus ... "
71987	71998	72000	72000	Snape	265	" Oh , I thought we 'd keep this private , "
72006	72022	72002	72002	his	265	" Students are n't supposed to know about the Sorcerer 's Stone , after all . "
72036	72052	72032	72032	Snape	265	" Have you found out how to get past that beast of Hagrid 's yet ? "
72053	72063	72002	72002	his	265	" B - b - but Severus , I -- "
72064	72076	72078	72078	Snape	265	" You do n't want me as your enemy , Quirrell , "
72086	72094	72078	72078	Snape	265	" I - I do n't know what you
72095	72104	72002	72002	his	265	" You know perfectly well what I mean . "
72129	72143	72126	72126	Snape	265	" -- your little bit of hocus - pocus . I 'm waiting . "
72144	72155	72126	72126	Snape	265	" B - but I d - d - don't -- "
72156	72160	72161	72161	Snape	265	" Very well , "
72165	72190	72161	72161	Snape	265	" We 'll have another little chat soon , when you 've had time to think things over and decided where your loyalties lie . "
72226	72234	72235	72235	Hermione	220	" Harry , where have you been ? "
72238	72248	72250	72250	Ron	194	" We won ! You won ! We won ! "
72258	72328	72250	72250	Ron	194	" And I gave Malfoy a black eye , and Neville tried to take on Crabbe and Goyle single - handed ! He 's still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he 'll be all right - talk about showing Slytherin ! Everyone 's waiting for you in the common room , we 're having a party , Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff from the kitchens . "
72329	72335	72337	72337	Harry	284	" Never mind that now , "
72340	72356	72337	72337	Harry	284	" Let 's find an empty room , you wait ' til you hear this .... "
72382	72466	72372	72372	he	284	" So we were right , it is the Sorcerer 's Stone , and Snape 's trying to force Quirrell to help him get it . He asked if he knew how to get past Fluffy - and he said something about Quirrell 's ' hocus pocuss-- I reckon there are other things guarding the stone apart from Fluffy , loads of enchantments , probably , and Quirrell would have done some anti - Dark Arts spell that Snape needs to break through -- "
72467	72485	72487	72487	Hermione	220	" So you mean the Stone 's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape ? "
72491	72500	72502	72502	Ron	194	" It 'll be gone by next Tuesday , "
72671	72680	72662	72662	she	220	" Hermione , the exams are ages away . "
72681	72685	72686	72686	Hermione	220	" Ten weeks , "
72689	72704	72686	72686	Hermione	220	" That 's not ages , that 's like a second to Nicolas Flamel . "
72705	72715	72716	72716	Ron	194	" But we 're not six hundred years old , "
72720	72734	72716	72716	Ron	194	" Anyway , what are you studying for , you already know it A. "
72735	72785	72686	72686	Hermione	220	" What am I studying for ? Are you crazy ? You realize we need to pass these exams to get into the second year ? They 're very important , I should have started studying a month ago , I do n't know what 's gotten into me .... "
72874	72881	72882	72882	Ron	194	" I 'll never remember this , "
72945	72947	73007	73007	he	284	" Dittany "
72966	72977	72963	72963	Ron	194	" Hagrid ! What are you doing in the library ? "
73000	73006	73007	73007	he	284	" Jus ' lookin ' , "
73021	73031	73007	73007	he	284	" An ' what 're you lot up ter ? "
73037	73050	73032	73032	He	284	" Yer not still lookin ' fer Nicolas Flamel , are yeh ? "
73051	73063	73065	73065	Ron	194	" Oh , we found out who he is ages ago , "
73068	73085	73065	73065	Ron	194	" And we know what that dog 's guarding , it 's a Sorcerer 's St -- "
73086	73089	73090	73090	Hagrid	284	" Shhhh ! "
73101	73117	73090	73090	Hagrid	284	" Don ' go shoutin ' about it , what 's the matter with yeh ? "
73118	73136	73138	73138	Harry	284	" There are a few things we wanted to ask you , as a matter of fact , "
73140	73151	73138	73138	Harry	284	" about what 's guarding the Stone apart from Fluffy -- "
73152	73155	73157	73157	Hagrid	284	" SHHHH ! "
73160	73209	73157	73157	Hagrid	284	" Listen - come an ' see me later , I 'm not promisin ' I 'll tell yeh anythin ' , mind , but don ' go rabbitin ' about it in here , students aren ' s'pposed ter know . They 'll think I 've told yeh- "
73210	73217	73219	73219	Harry	284	" See you later , then , "
73225	73234	73236	73236	Hermione	220	" What was he hiding behind his back ? "
73239	73252	73236	73236	Hermione	220	" Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone ? "
73253	73265	73267	73267	Ron	194	" I 'm going to see what section he was in , "
73298	73301	73302	73302	he	194	" Dragons ! "
73305	73337	73302	73302	he	194	" Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons ! Look at these : Dragon Species of Great Britain and Ireland ; From Egg to Inferno , A Dragon Keeper 's Guide . "
73338	73358	73360	73360	Harry	284	" Hagrid 's always wanted a dragon , he told me so the first time I ever met him , "
73362	73370	73372	73372	Ron	194	" But it 's against our laws , "
73374	73436	73372	73372	Ron	194	" Dragon breeding was outlawed by the Warlocks ' Convention of 1709 , everyone knows that . It 's hard to stop Muggles from noticing us if we 're keeping dragons in the back garden - anyway , you ca n't tame dragons , it 's dangerous . You should see the burns Charlie 's got off wild ones in Romania . "
73437	73447	73449	73449	Harry	284	" But there are n't wild dragons in Britain ? "
73451	73457	73459	73459	Ron	194	" Of course there are , "
73461	73504	73459	73459	Ron	194	" Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks . The Ministry of Magic has a job hushing them up , I can tell you . Our kind have to keep putting spells on Muggles who 've spotted them , to make them forget . "
73505	73514	73516	73516	Hermione	220	" So what on earths Hagrid up to ? "
73547	73552	73554	73554	he	284	" Who is it ? "
73606	73616	73592	73592	Hagrid	284	" So -- yeh wanted to ask me somethin' ? "
73617	73620	73622	73622	Harry	284	" Yes , "
73633	73653	73622	73622	Harry	284	" We were wondering if you could tell us what 's guarding the Sorcerer 's Stone apart from Fluffy . "
73659	73670	73654	73654	Hagrid	284	" 0 ' course I ca nt , he said . "
73735	73735	73733	73733	Fluffy	328	"
73736	73766	73768	73768	Hermione	220	" Oh , come on , Hagrid , you might not want to tell us , but you do know , you know everything that goes on round here , "
73788	73800	73784	73784	he	284	" We only wondered who had done the guarding , really . "
73805	73821	73784	73784	he	284	" We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him , apart from you . "
73838	73881	73882	73882	he	2001	" Well , I don ' s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that ... let 's see ... he borrowed Fluffy from me ... then some o ' the teachers did enchantments ... Professor Sprout -- Professor Flitwick -- Professor McGonagall -- "
73890	73919	73882	73882	he	2001	" Professor Quirrell -- an ' Dumbledore himself did somethin' , o ' course . Hang on , I 've forgotten someone . Oh yeah , Professor Snape . "
73920	73923	73882	73882	he	2001	" Snape ? "
73924	73954	73882	73882	he	2001	" Yeah -- yer not still on abou ' that , are yeh ? Look , Snape helped protect the Stone , he 's not about ter steal it . "
74014	74034	74036	74036	Harry	284	" You 're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy . are n't you , Hagrid ? "
74039	74057	74036	74036	Harry	284	" And you would n't tell anyone , would you ? Not even one of the teachers ? "
74058	74069	74071	74071	Hagrid	284	" Not a soul knows except me an ' Dumbledore , "
74074	74081	74082	74082	Harry	284	" Well , that 's something , "
74088	74102	74082	74082	Harry	284	" Hagrid , can we have a window open ? I 'm boiling . "
74103	74111	74113	74113	Hagrid	284	" Ca n't , Harry , sorry , "
74130	74137	74123	74123	Harry	284	" Hagrid -- what 's that ? "
74165	74168	74170	74170	Hagrid	284	" Ah , "
74178	74183	74170	74170	Hagrid	284	" That 's er ... "
74184	74193	74195	74195	Ron	194	" Where did you get it , Hagrid ? "
74210	74219	74195	74195	Ron	194	" It must 've cost you a fortune . "
74220	74224	74226	74226	Hagrid	284	" Won it , "
74228	74271	74226	74226	Hagrid	284	" Las ' night . I was down in the village havin' a few drinks an ' got into a game o ' cards with a stranger . Think he was quite glad ter get rid of it , ter be honest . "
74272	74287	74289	74289	Hermione	220	" But what are you going to do with it when it 's hatched ? "
74291	74314	74195	74195	Ron	194	" Well , I 've bin doin' some readin ' , said Hagrid , pulling a large book from under his pillow . "
74411	74411	74409	74409	them	2005	"
74424	74434	74435	74435	she	220	" Hagrid , you live in a wooden house , "
74483	74495	74496	74496	Ron	194	" Wonder what it 's like to have a peaceful life , "
74579	74597	74572	74572	Hermione	220	" Hermione , how many times in our lives are we going to see a dragon hatching ? "
74598	74631	74572	74572	Hermione	220	" We 've got lessons , we 'll get into trouble , and that 's nothing to what Hagrid 's going to be in when someone finds out what he 's doing -- "
74632	74636	74637	74637	Harry	284	" Shut up ! "
74748	74754	74755	74755	He	284	" It 's nearly out . "
74887	74893	74894	74894	Hagrid	284	" Is n't he beautiful ? "
74919	74930	74932	74932	Hagrid	284	" Bless him , look , he knows his mommy ! "
74934	74937	74939	74939	Hermione	220	" Hagrid , "
74941	74951	74939	74939	Hermione	220	" how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow , exactly ? "
74976	74982	74965	74965	he	284	" What 's the matter ? "
74983	75010	74965	74965	he	284	" Someone was lookin ' through the gap in the curtains -- it 's a kid -- he 's runnin ' back up ter the school . "
75078	75084	75085	75085	Harry	284	" Just let him go , "
75088	75093	75085	75085	Harry	284	" Set him free . "
75094	75099	75101	75101	Hagrid	284	" I ca n't , "
75103	75113	75101	75101	Hagrid	284	" He 's too little . He 'd die . "
75170	75179	75181	75181	Hagrid	284	" I 've decided to call him Norbert , "
75191	75208	75181	75181	Hagrid	284	" He really knows me now , watch . Norbert ! Norbert ! Where 's Mommy ? "
75209	75216	75217	75217	Ron	194	" He 's lost his marbles , "
75224	75227	75229	75229	Harry	284	" Hagrid , "
75232	75258	75229	75229	Harry	284	" give it two weeks and Norbert 's going to be as long as your house . Malfoy could go to Dumbledore at any moment . "
75264	75289	75259	75259	Hagrid	284	" I -- I know I ca n't keep him forever , but I ca n't jus ' dump him , I ca n't . "
75301	75309	75311	75311	Ron	194	" You 're losing it , too , "
75313	75320	75311	75311	Ron	194	" I 'm Ron , remember ? "
75321	75359	75298	75298	he	194	" No -- Charlie -- your brother , Charlie . In Romania . Studying dragons . We could send Norbert to him . Charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild ! "
75360	75363	75365	75365	Ron	194	" Brilliant ! "
75367	75374	75365	75365	Ron	194	" How about it , Hagrid ? "
75476	75481	75482	75482	he	194	" It bit me ! "
75498	75574	75482	75482	he	194	" I 'm not going to be able to hold a quill for a week . I tell you , that dragon 's the most horrible animal I 've ever met , but the way Hagrid goes on about it , you 'd think it was a fluffy little bunny rabbit . When it bit me he told me off for frightening it . And when I left , he was singing it a lullaby . "
75584	75589	75591	75591	Harry	284	" It 's Hedwig ! "
75599	75607	75591	75591	Harry	284	" She 'll have Charlie 's answer ! "
75738	75746	75748	75748	Harry	284	" We 've got the invisibility cloak , "
75750	75772	75748	75748	Harry	284	" It should n't be too difficult -- I think the cloaks big enough to cover two of us and Norbert . "
75902	75910	75911	75911	he	194	" It 's not just my hand , "
75914	75997	75911	75911	he	194	" although that feels like it 's about to fall off . Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borrow one of my books so he could come and have a good laugh at me . He kept threatening to tell her what really bit me -- I 've told her it was a dog , but I do n't think she believes me -I should n't have hit him at the Quidditch match , that 's why he 's doing this . "
76007	76018	76020	76020	Hermione	220	" It 'll all be over at midnight on Saturday , "
76045	76050	76051	76051	he	194	" Midnight on Saturday ! "
76058	76091	76051	76051	he	194	" Oh no oh no -- I 've just remembered -- Charlie 's letter was in that book Malfoy took , he 's going to know we 're getting rid of Norbert . "
76120	76131	76132	76132	Harry	284	" It 's too late to change the plan now , "
76136	76183	76132	76132	Harry	284	" We have n't got time to send Charlie another owl , and this could be our only chance to get rid of Norbert . We 'll have to risk it . And we have got the invisibility cloak , Malfoy does n't know about that . "
76213	76221	76222	76222	he	284	" I wo n't let you in , "
76225	76239	76222	76222	he	284	" Norbert 's at a tricky stage -- nothin' I ca n't handle . "
76270	76298	76261	76261	Norbert	340	" Aargh ! It 's all right , he only got my boot -- jus ' playin ' -- he 's only a baby , after all . "
76423	76439	76441	76441	Hagrid	284	" He 's got lots o ' rats an ' some brandy fer the journey , "
76447	76462	76441	76441	Hagrid	284	" An ' I 've packed his teddy bear in case he gets lonely . "
76485	76492	76493	76493	Hagrid	284	" Bye - bye , Norbert ! "
76513	76520	76511	76511	themselves	2038	" Mommy will never forget you ! "
76580	76584	76585	76585	Harry	284	" Nearly there ! "
76662	76665	76666	76666	she	2049	" Detention ! "
76669	76689	76666	76666	she	2049	" And twenty points from Slytherin ! Wandering around in the middle of the night , how dare you -- "
76690	76709	76644	76645	Professor McGonagall	106	" You do n't understand , Professor . Harry Potter 's coming -- he 's got a dragon ! "
76710	76735	76666	76666	she	2049	" What utter rubbish ! How dare you tell such lies ! Come on -- I shall see Professor Snape about you , Malfoy ! "
76791	76801	76784	76784	Hermione	220	" Malfoy 's got detention ! I could sing ! "
76802	76806	76807	76807	Harry	98	" Do n't , "
76970	76977	76978	76978	he	275	" Well , well , well , "
76981	76987	76978	76978	he	275	" we are in trouble . "
77186	77189	77190	77190	Neville	197	" Harry ! "
77202	77231	77190	77190	Neville	197	" I was trying to find you to warn you , I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you , he said you had a drag -- "
77266	77300	77258	77258	she	220	" I would never have believed it of any of you . Mr. Filch says you were up in the astronomy tower . It 's one o'clock in the morning . Explain yourselves . "
77330	77346	77348	77349	Professor McGonagall	106	" I think I 've got a good idea of what 's been going on , "
77351	77414	77348	77349	Professor McGonagall	106	" It does n't take a genius to work it out . You fed Draco Malfoy some cock - and - bull story about a dragon , trying to get him out of bed and into trouble . I 've already caught him . I suppose you think it 's funny that Longbottom here heard the story and believed it , too ? "
77467	77472	77474	77475	Professor McGonagall	106	" I 'm disgusted , "
77477	77572	77474	77475	Professor McGonagall	106	" Four students out of bed in one night ! I 've never heard of such a thing before ! You , Miss Granger , I thought you had more sense . As for you , Mr. Potter , I thought Gryffindor meant more to you than this . All three of you will receive detentions -- yes , you too , Mr. Longbottom , nothing gives you the right to walk around school at night , especially these days , it 's very dangerous -- and fifty points will be taken from Gryffindor . "
77573	77576	77577	77577	Harry	98	" Fifty ? "
77597	77602	77610	77610	her	2072	" Fifty points each , "
77616	77619	77610	77610	her	2072	" Professor -- please
77620	77625	77474	77475	Professor McGonagall	106	" You ca n't -- "
77626	77661	77610	77610	her	2072	" Do n't tell me what I can and ca n't do , Potter . Now get back to bed , all of you . I 've never been more ashamed of Gryffindor students . "
77932	77941	77923	77923	he	98	" Thanks Potter , we owe you one ! "
77948	77982	77910	77910	they	2363	" They 'll all forget this in a few weeks . Fred and George have lost loads of points in all the time they 've been here , and people still like them . "
77983	78002	78004	78004	Harry	98	" They 've never lost a hundred and fifty points in one go , though , have they ? "
78007	78012	78013	78013	Ron	194	" Well -- no , "
78075	78078	78079	78079	Wood	317	" Resign ? "
78082	78105	78079	78079	Wood	317	" What good'll that do ? How are we going to get any points back if we ca n't win at Quidditch ? "
78139	78143	78136	78136	they	1757	" the Seeker . "
78334	78344	78330	78330	Quirrell	170	" No -- no -- not again , please -- "
78358	78365	78368	78368	Quirrell	170	" All right -- all right -- "
78532	78540	78542	78542	Ron	194	" Snape 's done it , then ! "
78544	78560	78542	78542	Ron	194	" If Quirrell 's told him how to break his Anti - Dark Force spell -- "
78561	78569	78571	78571	Hermione	220	" There 's still Fluffy , though , "
78573	78588	78590	78590	Ron	194	" Maybe Snape 's found out how to get past him without asking Hagrid , "
78602	78633	78590	78590	Ron	194	" I bet there 's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three - headed dog . So what do we do , Harry ? "
78653	78681	78647	78647	Hermione	220	" Go to Dumbledore . That 's what we should have done ages ago . If we try anything ourselves we 'll be thrown out for sure . "
78682	78690	78692	78692	Harry	284	" But we 've got no proof ! "
78694	78823	78692	78692	Harry	284	" Quirrell 's too scared to back us up . Snape 's only got to say he does n't know how the troll got in at Halloween and that he was nowhere near the third floor -- who do you think they 'll believe , him or us ? It 's not exactly a secret we hate him , Dumbledore'll think we made it up to get him sacked . Filch would n't help us if his life depended on it , he 's too friendly with Snape , and the more students get thrown out , the better , he 'll think . And do n't forget , we 're not supposed to know about the Stone or Fluffy . That 'll take a lot of explaining . "
78833	78844	78890	78890	Hermione	220	" If we just do a bit of poking around -- "
78845	78848	78850	78850	Harry	284	" No , "
78853	78861	78850	78850	Harry	284	" we 've done enough poking around . "
79030	79034	79036	79036	Filch	267	" Follow me , "
79065	79073	79046	79046	I	0	" he said , leering at them . "
79163	79163	79164	79164	They	2098	"
79238	79254	79286	79286	Filch	267	" Is that you , Filch ? Hurry up , I want ter get started . "
79289	79333	79286	79286	Filch	267	" I suppose you think you 'll be enjoying yourself with that oaf ? Well , think again , boy -- it 's into the forest you 're going and I 'm much mistaken if you 'll all come out in one piece . "
79352	79356	79357	79357	he	225	" The forest ? "
79371	79394	79361	79361	he	225	" We ca n't go in there at night -- there 's all sorts of things in there- werewolves , I heard . "
79409	79419	79421	79421	Filch	267	" That 's your problem , is n't it ? "
79429	79446	79423	79423	his	267	" Should 've thought of them werewolves before you got in trouble , should n't you ? "
79479	79484	79485	79485	he	284	" Abou ' time , "
79488	79506	79485	79485	he	284	" I bin waitin ' fer half an hour already . All right , Harry , Hermione ? "
79507	79519	79521	79521	Filch	267	" I should n't be too friendly to them , Hagrid , "
79534	79534	79521	79521	Filch	267	"
79535	79545	79547	79547	Hagrid	284	" That 's why yer late , is it ? "
79553	79581	79547	79547	Hagrid	284	" Bin lecturin ' them , eh ? ' Snot your place ter do that . Yeh've done yer bit , I 'll take over from here . "
79582	79590	79592	79592	Filch	267	" I 'll be back at dawn , "
79594	79602	79603	79603	he	267	" for what 's left of them , "
79631	79656	79547	79547	Hagrid	284	" I 'm not going in that forest , he said , and Harry was pleased to hear the note of panic in his voice .
79657	79668	79670	79670	Hagrid	284	" Yeh are if yeh want ter stay at Hogwarts , "
79673	79687	79670	79670	Hagrid	284	" Yeh've done wrong an ' now yehve got ter pay fer it . "
79688	79723	79547	79547	Hagrid	284	" But this is servant stuff , it 's not for students to do . I thought we 'd be copying lines or something , if my father knew I was doing this , he 'd
79734	79738	79670	79670	Hagrid	284	" Hagrid growled . "
79782	79783	79789	79789	He	225	" '
79801	79805	79807	79807	Hagrid	284	" Right then , "
79809	79846	79807	79807	Hagrid	284	" now , listen carefully , 'cause it 's dangerous what we 're gon na do tonight , an ' I don ' want no one takin ' risks . Follow me over here a moment . "
79894	79898	79900	79900	Hagrid	284	" Look there , "
79902	79971	79900	79900	Hagrid	284	" see that stuff shinin ' on the ground ? Silvery stuff ? That 's unicorn blood . There 's a unicorn in there bin hurt badly by summat . This is the second time in a week . I found one dead last Wednesday . We 're gon na try an ' find the poor thing . We might have ter put it out of its misery . "
79972	79984	79986	79986	Malfoy	225	" And what if whatever hurt the unicorn finds us first ? "
79998	80018	80020	80020	Hagrid	284	" There 's nothin' that lives in the forest that 'll hurt yeh if yer with me or Fang , "
80022	80072	80020	80020	Hagrid	284	" An ' keep ter the path . Right , now , we 're gon na split inter two parties an ' follow the trail in diff'rent directions . There 's blood all over the place , it must 've bin staggerin ' around since last night at least . "
80073	80078	80080	80080	Malfoy	225	" I want Fang , "
80090	80104	80106	80106	Hagrid	284	" All right , but I warn yeh , he 's a coward , "
80108	80198	80106	80106	Hagrid	284	" So me , Harry , an ' Hermione'll go one way an ' Draco , Neville , an ' Fang'll go the other . Now , if any of us finds the unicorn , we 'll send up green sparks , right ? Get yer wands out an ' practice now -- that 's it -- an ' if anyone gets in trouble , send up red sparks , an ' we 'll all come an ' find yeh -- so , be careful -- let 's go . "
80286	80295	80296	80296	Harry	284	" Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns ? "
80299	80304	80306	80306	Hagrid	284	" Not fast enough , "
80308	80333	80306	80306	Hagrid	284	" It 's not easy ter catch a unicorn , they 're powerful magic creatures . I never knew one ter be hurt before . "
80372	80379	80380	80380	Hagrid	284	" You all right , Hermione ? "
80383	80415	80380	80380	Hagrid	284	" Don ' worry , it ca n't 've gone far if it 's this badly hurt , an ' then we 'll be able ter -- GET BEHIND THAT TREE ! "
80494	80499	80500	80500	he	284	" I knew it , "
80503	80514	80500	80500	he	284	" There 's summat in here that shouldn ' be . "
80515	80519	80520	80520	Harry	284	" A werewolf ? "
80523	80539	80541	80541	Hagrid	284	" That wasn ' no werewolf an ' it wasn ' no unicorn , neither , "
80544	80555	80541	80541	Hagrid	284	" Right , follow me , but careful , now . "
80579	80584	80585	80585	Hagrid	284	" Who 's there ? "
80588	80596	80585	80585	Hagrid	284	" Show yerself -- I 'm armed ! "
80649	80658	80660	80660	Hagrid	284	" Oh , it 's you , Ronan , "
80664	80669	80660	80660	Hagrid	284	" How are yeh ? "
80680	80688	80690	80690	Ronan	349	" Good evening to you , Hagrid , "
80700	80708	80692	80692	He	349	" Were you going to shoot me ? "
80709	80718	80720	80720	Hagrid	284	" Ca n't be too careful , Ronan , "
80726	80770	80720	80720	Hagrid	284	" There 's summat bad loose in this forest . This is Harry Potter an ' Hermione Granger , by the way . Students up at the school . An ' this is Ronan , you two . He 's a centaur . ) )
80771	80776	80778	80778	Hermione	220	" We 'd noticed , "
80781	80785	80787	80787	Ronan	349	" Good evening , "
80789	80806	80787	80787	Ronan	349	" Students , are you ? And do you learn much , up at the school ? "
80807	80810	80720	80720	Hagrid	284	" Erm -- "
80811	80815	80817	80817	Hermione	220	" A bit , "
80820	80830	80831	80831	Ronan	349	" A bit . Well , that 's something . "
80845	80851	80834	80834	He	349	" Mars is bright tonight . "
80852	80855	80857	80857	Hagrid	284	" Yeah , "
80864	80891	80857	80857	Hagrid	284	" Listen , I 'm glad we 've run inter yeh , Ronan , 'cause there 's a unicorn bin hurt -- you seen anythin ' ? "
80907	80916	80917	80917	he	349	" Always the innocent are the first victims , "
80920	80934	80917	80917	he	349	" So it has been for ages past , so it is now . "
80935	80938	80940	80940	Hagrid	284	" Yeah , "
80942	80956	80940	80940	Hagrid	284	" but have yeh seen anythin ' , Ronan ? Anythin ' unusual ? "
80957	80963	80964	80964	Ronan	349	" Mars is bright tonight , "
80973	80977	80968	80968	Hagrid	284	" Unusually bright . "
80978	80997	80940	80940	Hagrid	284	" Yeah , but I was meanin ' anythin ' unusual a bit nearer home , said Hagrid . "
81007	81007	80968	80968	Hagrid	284	"
81024	81031	81021	81021	he	349	" The forest hides many secrets . "
81066	81071	81073	81073	Hagrid	284	" Hullo , Bane , "
81075	81079	81073	81073	Hagrid	284	" All right ? "
81080	81092	81038	81038	Ronan	349	" Good evening , Hagrid , I hope you are well ? "
81093	81132	81073	81073	Hagrid	284	" Well enough . Look , I 've jus ' bin askin ' Ronan , you seen anythin ' odd in here lately ? There 's a unicorn bin injured -- would yeh know anythin ' about it ? "
81146	81152	81153	81153	he	351	" Mars is bright tonight , "
81157	81162	81164	81164	Hagrid	284	" We 've heard , "
81167	81194	81164	81164	Hagrid	284	" Well , if either of you do see anythin ' , let me know , wo n't yeh ? We 'll be off , then . "
81220	81223	81225	81225	Hagrid	284	" Never , "
81228	81253	81225	81225	Hagrid	284	" try an ' get a straight answer out of a centaur . Ruddy stargazers . Not interested in anythin ' closer'n the moon . "
81254	81263	81265	81265	Hermione	220	" Are there many of them in here ? "
81267	81316	81225	81225	Hagrid	284	" Oh , a fair few ... Keep themselves to themselves mostly , but they 're good enough about turnin ' up if ever I want a word . They 're deep , mind , centaurs ... they know things ... jus ' don ' let on much . "
81317	81328	81330	81330	Harry	284	" D'you think that was a centaur we heard earlier ? "
81332	81366	81330	81330	Harry	284	" Did that sound like hooves to you ? Nah , if yeh ask me , that was what 's bin killin ' the unicorns -- never heard anythin ' like it before . "
81424	81438	81418	81418	Hermione	220	" Hagrid ! Look ! Red sparks , the others are in trouble ! "
81439	81445	81446	81446	Hagrid	284	" You two wait here ! "
81449	81462	81446	81446	Hagrid	284	" Stay on the path , I 'll come back for yeh ! "
81495	81508	81510	81510	Hermione	220	" You do n't think they 've been hurt , do you ? "
81512	81540	81510	81510	Hermione	220	" I do n't care if Malfoy has , but if something 's got Neville ... it 's our fault he 's here in the first place . "
81632	81685	81686	81686	Hagrid	284	" We 'll be lucky ter catch anythin ' now , with the racket you two were makin ' . Right , we 're changin ' groups -- Neville , you stay with me an ' Hermione , Harry , you go with Fang an ' this idiot . I 'm sorry , "
81694	81716	81686	81686	Hagrid	284	" but he 'll have a harder time frightenin ' you , an ' we 've got ta get this done . "
81812	81815	81816	81816	he	284	" Look -- "
81973	81976	81955	81955	its	2144	" AAAAAAAAAARGH ! "
82140	82146	82148	82149	the centaur	2129	" Are you all right ? "
82157	82167	82148	82149	the centaur	2129	" Yes -- thank you -- what was that ? "
82207	82214	82215	82215	he	2129	" You are the Potter boy , "
82218	82250	82215	82215	he	2129	" You had better get back to Hagrid . The forest is not safe at this time -- especially for you . Can you ride ? It will be quicker this way .
82251	82257	82258	82258	he	2129	" My name is Firenze , "
82310	82313	82314	82314	Bane	351	" Firenze ! "
82317	82342	82314	82314	Bane	351	" What are you doing ? You have a human on your back ! Have you no shame ? Are you a common mule ? "
82343	82351	82353	82353	Firenze	352	" Do you realize who this is ? "
82355	82372	82353	82353	Firenze	352	" This is the Potter boy . The quicker he leaves this forest , the better . "
82373	82381	82383	82383	Bane	351	" What have you been telling him ? "
82385	82416	82383	82383	Bane	351	" Remember , Firenze , we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens . Have we not read what is to come in the movements of the planets ? "
82423	82436	82437	82437	he	349	" I 'm sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best , "
82452	82491	82444	82444	Bane	351	" For the best ! What is that to do with us ? Centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold ! It is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest ! "
82515	82523	82524	82524	Firenze	352	" Do you not see that unicorn ? "
82529	82574	82524	82524	Firenze	352	" Do you not understand why it was killed ? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret ? I set myself against what is lurking in this forest , Bane , yes , with humans alongside me if I must . "
82614	82621	82622	82622	he	284	" Why 's Bane so angry ? "
82625	82637	82622	82622	he	284	" What was that thing you saved me from , anyway ? "
82710	82724	82706	82706	Firenze	352	" Harry Potter , do you know what unicorn blood is used -for ? "
82725	82728	82730	82730	Harry	98	" No , "
82738	82751	82730	82730	Harry	98	" We 've only used the horn and tail hair in Potions . "
82752	82767	82769	82769	Firenze	352	" That is because it is a monstrous thing , to slay a unicorn , "
82771	82850	82769	82769	Firenze	352	" Only one who has nothing to lose , and everything to gain , would commit such a crime . The blood of a unicorn will keep you alive , even if you are an inch from death , but at a terrible price . You have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself , and you will have but a half - life , a cursed life , from the moment the blood touches your lips . "
82869	82877	82878	82878	he	98	" But who 'd be that desperate ? "
82882	82899	82878	82878	he	98	" If you 're going to be cursed forever , deaths better , is n't it ? "
82900	82904	82905	82905	Firenze	352	" It is , "
82908	82962	82905	82905	Firenze	352	" unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else -- something that will bring you back to full strength and power -- something that will mean you can never die . Mr. Potter , do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment ? "
82963	82984	82878	82878	he	98	" The Sorcerer 's Stone ! Of course -- the Elixir of Life ! But I do n't understand who -- "
82985	83011	82905	82905	Firenze	352	" Can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power , who has clung to life , awaiting their chance ? "
83052	83076	83041	83041	Hagrid	284	" Some say he died . Codswallop , in my opinion . Dunno if he had enough human left in him to die . "
83077	83082	83083	83083	Harry	284	" Do you mean , "
83086	83090	83083	83083	Harry	284	" that was Vol- "
83091	83101	83041	83041	Hagrid	284	" Harry ! Harry , are you all right ? "
83117	83122	83124	83124	Harry	284	" I 'm fine , "
83133	83149	83124	83124	Harry	284	" The unicorn 's dead , Hagrid , it 's in that clearing back there . "
83150	83158	83159	83159	Firenze	352	" This is where I leave you , "
83170	83176	83162	83162	Hagrid	284	" You are safe now . "
83183	83190	83192	83192	Firenze	352	" Good luck , Harry Potter , "
83194	83217	83192	83192	Firenze	352	" The planets have been read wrongly before now , even by centaurs . I hope this is one of those times . "
83315	83344	83310	83310	He	98	" Snape wants the stone for Voldemort ... and Voldemort 's waiting in the forest ... and all this time we thought Snape just wanted to get rich .... "
83345	83351	83353	83353	Ron	194	" Stop saying the name ! "
83373	83435	83361	83361	he	194	" Firenze saved me , but he should n't have done so .... Bane was furious ... he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen .... They must show that Voldemort 's coming back .... Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me .... I suppose that 's written in the stars as well . "
83436	83444	83445	83445	Ron	194	" Will you stop saying the name ! "
83448	83465	83466	83466	Harry	98	" So all I 've got to wait for now is Snape to steal the Stone , "
83471	83492	83466	83466	Harry	98	" then Voldemort will be able to come and finish me off ... Well , I suppose Bane'll be happy . "
83506	83570	83499	83499	she	220	" Harry , everyone says Dumbledore 's the only one You - Know - Who was ever afraid of With Dumbledore around , You - Know - Who wo n't touch you . Anyway , who says the centaurs are right ? It sounds like fortune - telling to me , and Professor McGonagall says that 's a very imprecise branch of magic . "
84042	84054	84056	84056	Hermione	220	" That was far easier than I thought it would be , "
84069	84090	84056	84056	Hermione	220	" I need n't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager . "
84147	84152	84153	84153	Ron	194	" No more studying , "
84163	84195	84153	84153	Ron	194	" You could look more cheerful , Harry , we 've got a week before we find out how badly we 've done , there 's no need to worry yet . "
84202	84211	84212	84212	he	106	" I wish I knew what this means ! "
84217	84235	84212	84212	he	106	" My scar keeps hurting -- it 's happened before , but never as often as this . "
84236	84242	84243	84243	Hermione	220	" Go to Madam Pomfrey , "
84246	84252	84254	84254	Harry	106	" I 'm not ill , "
84256	84270	84254	84254	Harry	106	" I think it 's a warning ... it means danger 's coming .... "
84283	84354	84387	84387	Hermione	220	" Harry , relax , Hermione 's right , the Stone 's safe as long as Dumbledore 's around . Anyway , we 've never had any proof Snape found out how to get past Fluffy . He nearly had his leg ripped off once , he 's not going to try it again in a hurry . And Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down . "
84390	84418	84387	84387	Hermione	220	" That 's just the exams . I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we 'd done that one . "
84497	84503	84505	84505	Ron	194	" Where 're you going ? "
84508	84516	84518	84518	Harry	284	" I 've just thought of something , "
84525	84537	84520	84520	He	284	" We 've got to go and see Hagrid , now . "
84538	84541	84543	84543	Hermione	220	" Why ? "
84550	84561	84563	84563	Harry	284	" Do n't you think it 's a bit odd , "
84571	84633	84563	84563	Harry	284	" that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is a dragon , and a stranger turns up who just happens to have an egg in his pocket ? How many people wander around with dragon eggs if it 's against wizard law ? Lucky they found Hagrid , do n't you think ? Why did n't I see it before ? "
84634	84641	84643	84643	Ron	194	" What are you talking about ? "
84688	84691	84692	84692	he	284	" Hullo , "
84697	84708	84692	84692	he	284	" Finished yer exams ? Got time fer a drink ? "
84709	84714	84716	84716	Ron	194	" Yes , please , "
84724	84763	84692	84692	he	284	" No , we 're in a hurry . Hagrid , I 've got to ask you something . You know that night you won Norbert ? What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like ? "
84764	84767	84769	84769	Hagrid	284	" Dunno , "
84772	84781	84769	84769	Hagrid	284	" he wouldn ' take his cloak off . "
84795	84847	84692	84692	he	284	" It 's not that unusual , yeh get a lot o ' funny folk in the Hog 's Head -- that 's the pub down in the village . Mighta bin a dragon dealer , mightn ' he ? I never saw his face , he kept his hood up . "
84858	84876	84848	84848	Harry	284	" What did you talk to him about , Hagrid ? Did you mention Hogwarts at all ? "
84877	84882	84884	84884	Hagrid	284	" Mighta come up , "
84893	85025	84884	84884	Hagrid	284	" Yeah ... he asked what I did , an ' I told him I was gamekeeper here .... He asked a bit about the sorta creatures I took after ... so I told him ... an ' I said what I 'd always really wanted was a dragon ... an ' then ... I can ' remember too well , 'cause he kept buyin ' me drinks .... Let 's see ... yeah , then he said he had the dragon egg an ' we could play cards fer it if I wanted ... but he had ter be sure I could handle it , he didn ' want it ter go ter any old home .... So I told him , after Fluffy , a dragon would be easy ... "
85026	85038	85039	85039	Harry	284	" And did he -- did he seem interested in Fluffy ? "
85050	85108	84884	84884	Hagrid	284	" Well -- yeah -- how many three - headed dogs d'yeh meet , even around Hogwarts ? So I told him , Fluffy 's a piece o ' cake if yeh know how to calm him down , jus ' play him a bit o ' music an ' he 'll go straight off ter sleep -- "
85114	85121	85122	85122	he	284	" I shouldn'ta told yeh that ! "
85126	85139	85122	85122	he	284	" Forget I said it ! Hey -- where 're yeh goin' ? "
85175	85184	85186	85186	Harry	284	" We 've got to go to Dumbledore , "
85188	85248	85186	85186	Harry	284	" Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy , and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak -- it must 've been easy , once he 'd got Hagrid drunk . I just hope Dumbledore believes us . Firenze might back us up if Bane does n't stop him . Where 's Dumbledore 's office ? "
85289	85296	85297	85297	Harry	284	" We 'll just have to -- "
85309	85317	85318	85318	It	2189	" What are you three doing inside ? "
85330	85338	85340	85340	Hermione	220	" We want to see Professor Dumbledore , "
85350	85355	85356	85357	Professor McGonagall	106	" See Professor Dumbledore ? "
85373	85376	85356	85357	Professor McGonagall	106	" Why ? "
85383	85390	85391	85391	he	106	" It 's sort of secret , "
85410	85418	85419	85419	she	220	" Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago , "
85423	85442	85419	85419	she	220	" He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London at once . "
85443	85448	85450	85450	Harry	106	" He 's gone ? "
85453	85456	85450	85450	Harry	106	" Now ? "
85457	85475	85419	85419	she	220	" Professor Dumbledore is a very great wizard , Potter , he has many demands on his time --
85476	85482	85450	85450	Harry	106	" But this is important . "
85483	85499	85419	85419	she	220	" Something you have to say is more important than the Ministry of Magic , Potter .
85500	85503	85505	85505	Harry	98	" Look , "
85513	85524	85505	85505	Harry	98	" Professor -- it 's about the Sorcerer 's tone -- "
85555	85562	85563	85563	she	220	" How do you know -- ? "
85566	85597	85598	85598	She	220	" Professor , I think -- I know -- that Sn- that someone 's going to try and steal the Stone . I 've got to talk to Professor Dumbledore . "
85609	85617	85618	85618	she	220	" Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow , "
85651	85651	85673	85673	She	220	"
85652	85656	85618	85618	she	220	" But Professor -- "
85657	85668	85669	85669	she	220	" Potter , I know what I 'm talking about , "
85695	85695	85683	85683	I	0	"
85701	85706	85708	85708	Harry	98	" It 's tonight , "
85721	85770	85708	85708	Harry	98	" Snape 's going through the trapdoor tonight . He 's found out everything he needs , and now he 's got Dumbledore out of the way . He sent that note , I bet the Ministry of Magic will get a real shock when Dumbledore turns up . "
85771	85777	85797	85797	he	265	" But what can we -- "
85792	85796	85797	85797	he	265	" Good afternoon , "
85806	85818	85819	85819	he	265	" You should n't be inside on a day like this , "
85829	85833	85834	85834	Harry	106	" We were -- "
85847	85855	85857	85857	Snape	265	" You want to be more careful , "
85859	85861	85857	85857	Snape	265	" Hanging around
85889	85889	85875	85875	Gryffindor	317	"
85905	85930	85931	85931	He	265	" Be warned , Potter -- any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled . Good day to you . "
85953	85965	85966	85966	he	98	" Right , here 's what we 've got to do , "
85970	86004	85966	85966	he	98	" One of us has got to keep an eye on Snape -- wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it . Hermione , you 'd better do that . "
86005	86009	85947	85947	Harry	98	" Why me ? "
86010	86015	86017	86017	Ron	194	" It 's obvious , "
86019	86033	86034	86034	He	98	" You can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick , you know . "
86041	86062	86034	86034	He	98	" ' Oh Professor Flitwick , I 'm so worried , I think I got question fourteen b wrong .... ' "
86063	86069	86074	86074	she	220	" Oh , shut up , "
86084	86097	86098	86098	Harry	98	" And we 'd better stay outside the third - floor corridor , "
86102	86106	86098	86098	Harry	98	" Come on . "
86147	86164	86165	86165	she	2199	" I suppose you think you 're harder to get past than a pack of enchantments ! "
86168	86204	86165	86165	she	2199	" Enough of this nonsense ! If I hear you ' ve come anywhere near here again , I 'll take another fifty points from Gryffindor ! Yes , Weasley , from my own house ! "
86220	86230	86215	86215	Harry	106	" At least Hermione 's on Snape 's tail , "
86245	86252	86253	86253	she	220	" I 'm sorry , Harry ! "
86256	86300	86253	86253	she	220	" Snape came out and asked me what I was doing , so I said I was waiting for Flitwick , and Snape went to get him , and I 've only just got away , I do n't know where Snape went . "
86301	86313	86314	86314	Harry	106	" Well , that 's it then , is n't it ? "
86333	86354	86328	86328	his	106	" I 'm going out of here tonight and I 'm going to try and get to the Stone first . "
86355	86360	86362	86362	Ron	194	" You 're mad ! "
86364	86369	86371	86371	Hermione	220	" You ca n't ! "
86373	86387	86371	86371	Hermione	220	" After what McGonagall and Snape have said ? You 'll be expelled ! "
86388	86391	86392	86392	Harry	106	" SO WHAP "
86395	86566	86392	86392	Harry	106	" Do n't you understand ? If Snape gets hold of the Stone , Voldemort 's coming back ! Have n't you heard what it was like when he was trying to take over ? There wo n't be any Hogwarts to get expelled from ! He 'll flatten it , or turn it into a school for the Dark Arts ! Losing points does n't matter anymore , ca n't you see ? D'you think he 'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins the house cup ? If I get caught before I can get to the Stone , well , I 'll have to go back to the Dursleys and wait for Voldemort to find me there , it 's only dying a bit later than I would have , because I 'm never going over to the Dark Side ! I 'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going to stop me ! Voldemort killed my parents , remember ? "
86572	86578	86580	86580	Hermione	220	" You 're right Harry , "
86586	86594	86596	86596	Harry	106	" I 'll use the invisibility cloak , "
86598	86608	86596	86596	Harry	106	" It 's just lucky I got it back . "
86609	86619	86621	86621	Ron	194	" But will it cover all three of us ? "
86623	86631	86596	86596	Harry	106	" All -- all three of us ? "
86632	86650	86596	86596	Harry	106	" Oh , come off it , you do n't think we 'd let you go alone ? "
86651	86656	86658	86658	Hermione	220	" Of course not , "
86661	86691	86658	86658	Hermione	220	" How do you think you 'd get to the Stone without us ? I 'd better go and took through my books , there might be something useful ... "
86692	86707	86596	86596	Harry	106	" But if we get caught , you two will be expelled , too . "
86708	86716	86718	86718	Hermione	220	" Not if I can help it , "
86721	86748	86718	86718	Hermione	220	" Flitwick told me in secret that I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam . They 're not throwing me out after that . "
86853	86859	86860	86860	Ron	194	" Better get the cloak , "
86926	86959	86917	86917	He	106	" We 'd better put the cloak on here , and make sure it covers all three of us -- if Filch spots one of our feet wandering along on its own -- "
86960	86966	87021	87021	Neville	197	" What are you doing ? "
87002	87009	87011	87011	Harry	284	" Nothing , Neville , nothing , "
87028	87035	87036	87036	he	197	" You 're going out again , "
87039	87046	87048	87048	Hermione	220	" No , no , no , "
87050	87067	87048	87048	Hermione	220	" No , we 're not . Why do n't you go to bed , Neville ? "
87098	87105	87107	87107	Neville	197	" You ca n't go out , "
87109	87124	87107	87107	Neville	197	" you 'll be caught again . Gryffindor will be in even more trouble . "
87125	87131	87133	87133	Harry	284	" You do n't understand , "
87135	87140	87133	87133	Harry	284	" this is important . "
87160	87174	87175	87175	I	0	" he said , hurrying to stand in front of the portrait hole . "
87183	87183	87175	87175	I	0	"
87184	87187	87188	87188	Ron	194	" Neville , "
87191	87203	87188	87188	Ron	194	" get away from that hole and do n't be an idiot- "
87204	87213	87215	87215	Neville	197	" Do n't you call me an idiot ! "
87243	87243	87230	87230	you	2217	"
87244	87252	87254	87254	Ron	194	" Yes , but not to us , "
87258	87270	87254	87254	Ron	194	" Neville , you do n't know what you 're doing . "
87289	87299	87301	87301	Neville	197	" Go on then , try and hit me ! "
87307	87312	87301	87301	Neville	197	" I 'm ready ! "
87318	87322	87323	87323	he	284	" Do something , "
87331	87334	87335	87335	she	220	" Neville , "
87338	87348	87335	87335	she	220	" I 'm really , really sorry about this . "
87354	87358	87359	87359	she	220	" Petrificus Totalus ! "
87434	87442	87443	87443	Harry	284	" What 've you done to him ? "
87446	87455	87457	87457	Hermione	220	" It 's the full Body - Bind , "
87460	87470	87457	87457	Hermione	220	" Oh , Neville , I 'm so sorry . "
87471	87483	87485	87485	Harry	284	" We had to , Neville , no time to explain , "
87487	87495	87497	87497	Ron	194	" You 'll understand later , Neville , "
87572	87584	87585	87585	Ron	194	" Oh , let 's kick her , just this once , "
87652	87657	87658	87658	he	231	" Who 's there ? "
87674	87698	87667	87667	He	231	" Know you 're there , even if I ca n't see you . Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie ? "
87713	87730	87699	87699	He	231	" Should call Filch , I should , if something 's a - creeping around unseen . "
87737	87740	87741	87741	he	284	" Peeves , "
87749	87761	87741	87741	he	284	" the Bloody Baron has his own reasons for being invisible . "
87786	87798	87799	87799	he	231	" So sorry , your bloodiness , Mr. Baron , Sir , "
87803	87835	87799	87799	he	231	" My mistake , my mistake -- I did n't see you -- of course I did n't , you 're invisible -- forgive old Peevsie his little joke , sir . "
87836	87844	87846	87846	Harry	284	" I have business here , Peeves , "
87848	87856	87846	87846	Harry	284	" Stay away from this place tonight . "
87857	87868	87870	87870	Peeves	231	" I will , sir , I most certainly will , "
87879	87894	87870	87870	Peeves	231	" Hope your business goes well , Baron , I 'll not bother you . "
87899	87904	87906	87906	Ron	194	" Brilliant , Harry ! "
87930	87937	87938	87938	Harry	284	" Well , there you are , "
87942	87950	87938	87938	Harry	284	" Snape 's already got past Fluffy . "
87980	87994	87995	87995	he	284	" If you want to go back , I wo n't blame you , "
87998	88012	87995	87995	he	284	" You can take the cloak , I wo n't need it now . "
88013	88019	88021	88021	Ron	194	" Do n't be stupid , "
88023	88028	88030	88030	Hermione	220	" We 're coming , "
88072	88080	88081	88081	Hermione	220	" What 's that at its feet ? "
88084	88090	88092	88092	Ron	194	" Looks like a harp , "
88094	88102	88092	88092	Ron	194	" Snape must have left it there . "
88103	88114	88116	88116	Harry	284	" It must wake up the moment you stop playing , "
88118	88124	88116	88116	Harry	284	" Well , here goes ... "
88190	88194	88195	88195	Ron	194	" Keep playing , "
88228	88241	88243	88243	Ron	194	" I think we 'll be able to pull the door open , "
88252	88260	88243	88243	Ron	194	" Want to go first , Hermione ? "
88261	88268	88276	88276	his	194	" No , I do n't ! "
88269	88273	88274	88274	Ron	194	" All right . "
88303	88309	88310	88310	Hermione	220	" What can you see ? "
88314	88335	88310	88310	Hermione	220	" Nothing -- just black -- there 's no way of climbing down , we 'll just have to drop . "
88357	88368	88370	88370	Ron	194	" You want to go first ? Are you sure ? "
88372	88395	88370	88370	Ron	194	" I do n't know how deep this thing goes . Give the flute to Hermione so she can keep him asleep . "
88474	88498	88466	88466	he	284	" If anything happens to me , do n't follow . Go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore , right ? "
88499	88502	88504	88504	Ron	194	" Right , "
88506	88515	88466	88466	he	284	" See you in a minute , I hope ...
88582	88587	88588	88588	he	284	" It 's okay ! "
88607	88618	88588	88588	he	284	" it 's a soft landing , you can jump ! "
88632	88638	88640	88640	his	284	" What 's this stuff ? "
88644	88668	88624	88624	He	194	" Dunno , some sort of plant thing . I suppose it 's here to break the fall . Come on , Hermione ! "
88697	88708	88689	88689	She	220	" We must be miles under the school , she said .
88709	88719	88721	88721	Ron	194	" Lucky this plant thing 's here , really , "
88723	88726	88728	88728	Hermione	220	" Lucky ! "
88730	88736	88728	88728	Hermione	220	" Look at you both ! "
88841	88845	88846	88846	Hermione	220	" Stop moving ! "
88850	88863	88846	88846	Hermione	220	" I know what this is -- it 's Devil 's Snare ! "
88864	88884	88886	88886	Ron	194	" Oh , I 'm so glad we know what it 's called , that 's a great help , "
88902	88916	88918	88918	Hermione	220	" Shut up , I 'm trying to remember how to kill it ! "
88920	88931	88932	88932	Harry	284	" Well , hurry up , I ca n't breathe ! "
88945	88967	88932	88932	Harry	284	" Devil 's Snare , Devil 's Snare ... what did Professor Sprout say ? -- it likes the dark and the damp
88968	88974	88975	88975	Harry	284	" So light a fire ! "
88978	88990	88991	88991	Hermione	220	" Yes -- of course -- but there 's no wood ! "
88998	89004	89005	89005	Ron	194	" HAVE YOU GONE MAD ? "
89008	89016	89005	89005	Ron	194	" ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT ? "
89017	89022	89024	89024	Hermione	220	" Oh , right ! "
89100	89110	89112	89112	Harry	284	" Lucky you pay attention in Herbology , Hermione , "
89127	89130	89132	89132	Ron	194	" Yeah , "
89134	89156	89132	89132	Ron	194	" and lucky Harry does n't lose his head in a crisis -- ' there 's no wood , ' honestly . "
89157	89161	89163	89163	Harry	284	" This way , "
89250	89256	89257	89257	Ron	194	" Can you hear something ? "
89276	89285	89257	89257	Ron	194	" Do you think it 's a ghost ? "
89286	89298	89257	89257	Ron	194	" I do n't know ... sounds like wings to me . "
89299	89311	89257	89257	Ron	194	" There 's light ahead -- I can see something moving . "
89367	89381	89383	89383	Ron	194	" Do you think they 'll attack us if we cross the room ? "
89385	89388	89390	89390	Harry	284	" Probably , "
89392	89423	89390	89390	Harry	284	" They do n't look very vicious , but I suppose if they all swooped down at once ... well , there 's no other choice ... I 'll run . "
89506	89510	89512	89512	Ron	194	" Now what ? "
89514	89527	89529	89529	Hermione	220	" These birds ... they ca n't be here just for decoration , "
89542	89548	89549	89549	Harry	284	" They 're not birds ! "
89553	89569	89570	89570	he	284	" They 're keys ! Winged keys -- look carefully . So that must mean ... "
89587	89606	89570	89570	he	284	" ... yes -- look ! Broomsticks ! We 've got to catch the key to the door ! "
89607	89615	89616	89616	Ron	194	" But there are hundreds of them ! "
89624	89644	89616	89616	Ron	194	" We 're looking for a big , old - fashioned one -- probably silver , like the handle . "
89755	89759	89760	89760	he	284	" That one ! "
89766	89790	89760	89760	he	284	" That big one -- there -- no , there- with bright blue wings -- the feathers are all crumpled on one side . "
89814	89824	89825	89825	Harry	284	" We 've got to close in on it ! "
89840	89872	89825	89825	Harry	284	" Ron , you come at it from above -- Hermione , stay below and stop it from going down and I 'll try and catch it . Right , NOW ! "
89984	89987	89988	89988	Harry	284	" Ready ? "
90103	90110	90111	90111	Harry	284	" Now what do we do ? "
90114	90123	90125	90125	Ron	194	" It 's obvious , is n't it ? "
90127	90139	90125	90125	Ron	194	" We 've got to play our way across the room . "
90150	90153	90155	90155	Hermione	220	" How ? "
90158	90162	90164	90164	Ron	194	" I think , "
90166	90176	90164	90164	Ron	194	" we 're going to have to be chessmen . "
90223	90237	90238	90240	The black knight	2259	" Do we -- er -- have to join you to get across ? "
90250	90274	90243	90243	Ron	194	" This needs thinking about he said . I suppose we 've got to take the place of three of the black pieces .... "
90289	90309	90286	90286	he	194	" Now , do n't be offended or anything , but neither of you are that good at chess -- "
90310	90316	90318	90318	Harry	284	" We 're not offended , "
90321	90329	90318	90318	Harry	284	" Just tell us what to do . "
90330	90356	90286	90286	he	194	" Well , Harry , you take the place of that bishop , and Hermione , YOU 90 next to him instead of that castle . "
90357	90362	90318	90318	Harry	284	" What about you ? "
90363	90372	90374	90374	Ron	194	" I 'm going to be a knight , "
90423	90431	90433	90433	Ron	194	" White always plays first in chess , "
90440	90445	90433	90433	Ron	194	" Yes ... look ... "
90482	90493	90467	90467	he	194	" Harry -- move diagonally four squares to the right . "
90529	90536	90538	90538	Ron	194	" Had to let that happen , "
90543	90557	90538	90538	Ron	194	" Leaves you free to take that bishop , Hermione , go on . "
90624	90630	90631	90631	he	194	" We 're nearly there , "
90635	90643	90631	90631	he	194	" Let me think let me think ... "
90654	90657	90659	90659	Ron	194	" Yes ... "
90662	90676	90659	90659	Ron	194	" It 's the only way ... I 've got to be taken . "
90677	90683	90644	90646	The white queen	2269	" NOF Harry and Hermione shouted .
90684	90689	90691	90691	Ron	194	" That 's chess ! "
90693	90724	90691	90691	Ron	194	" You 've got to make some sacrifices ! I take one step forward and she 'll take me -- that leaves you free to checkmate the king , Harry ! "
90725	90728	90644	90646	The white queen	2269	" But -- "
90729	90739	90691	90691	Ron	194	" Do you want to stop Snape or not ? "
90740	90743	90644	90646	The white queen	2269	" Ron -- "
90744	90761	90691	90691	Ron	194	" Look , if you do n't hurry up , he 'll already have the Stone ! "
90767	90770	90771	90771	Ron	194	" Ready ? "
90780	90796	90774	90774	his	194	" Here I go - now , do n't hang around once you 've won . "
90916	90923	90905	90905	Hermione	220	" What if he 's -- ? "
90924	90931	90933	90933	Harry	284	" He 'll be all right , "
90940	90948	90933	90933	Harry	284	" What do you reckon 's next ? "
90949	90991	90905	90905	Hermione	220	" We 've had Sprout 's , that was the Devil 's Snare ; Flitwick must 've put charms on the keys ; McGonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive ; that leaves Quirrell 's spell , and Snape 's . "
90998	91002	91003	91003	Harry	106	" All right ? "
91006	91010	91011	91011	Harry	106	" Go on . "
91071	91084	91085	91085	Harry	106	" I 'm glad we did n't have to fight that one , "
91098	91107	91085	91085	Harry	106	" Come on , I ca n't breathe . "
91151	91155	91157	91157	Harry	106	" Snape 's , "
91159	91167	91157	91157	Harry	106	" What do we have to do ? "
91216	91219	91220	91220	Hermione	220	" Look ! "
91442	91445	91447	91447	Hermione	220	" Brilliant , "
91449	91484	91447	91447	Hermione	220	" This is n't magic -- it 's logic -- a puzzle . A lot of the greatest wizards have n't got an ounce of logic , they 'd be stuck in here forever . "
91485	91495	91429	91429	she	220	" But so will we , wo n't we ? "
91496	91501	91503	91503	Hermione	220	" Of course not , "
91505	91546	91503	91503	Hermione	220	" Everything we need is here on this paper . Seven bottles : three are poison ; two are wine ; one will get us safely through the black fire , and one will get us back through the purple . "
91547	91557	91429	91429	she	220	" But how do we know which to drink ? "
91558	91564	91503	91503	Hermione	220	" Give me a minute . "
91599	91603	91604	91604	she	220	" Got it , "
91607	91623	91594	91594	she	220	" The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire -- toward the Stone . "
91631	91642	91643	91643	he	106	" There 's only enough there for one of us , "
91646	91653	91643	91643	he	106	" That 's hardly one swallow . "
91660	91672	91654	91654	They	2294	" Which one will get you back through the purple flames ? "
91687	91692	91694	91694	Harry	106	" You drink that , "
91696	91764	91694	91694	Harry	106	" No , listen , get back and get Ron . Grab brooms from the flying- key room , they 'll get you out of the trapdoor and past Fluffy -- go straight to the owlery and send Hedwig to Dumbledore , we need him . I might be able to hold Snape off for a while , but I 'm no match for him , really . "
91765	91780	91810	91810	Hermione	220	" But Harry -- what if You - Know - Who 's with him ? "
91781	91793	91795	91795	Harry	106	" Well -- I was lucky once , was n't I ? "
91802	91809	91795	91795	Harry	106	" I might get lucky again . "
91828	91831	91816	91816	she	220	" Hermione ! "
91832	91844	91816	91816	she	220	" Harry -- you 're a great wizard , you know . "
91845	91854	91856	91856	Harry	106	" I 'm not as good as you , "
91868	91871	91873	91873	Hermione	220	" Me ! "
91875	91898	91873	91873	Hermione	220	" Books ! And cleverness ! There are more important things -- friendship and bravery and -- oh Harry -- be careful ! "
91899	91904	91906	91906	Harry	106	" You drink first , "
91908	91920	91906	91906	Harry	106	" You are sure which is which , are n't you ? "
91921	91924	91926	91926	Hermione	220	" Positive , "
91944	91950	91952	91952	Harry	106	" It 's not poison ? "
91955	91964	91988	91988	Hermione	220	" No -- but it 's like ice . "
91965	91975	91906	91906	Harry	106	" Quick , go , before it wears off . "
91976	91983	91988	91988	Hermione	220	" Good luck -- take care . "
91984	91987	91906	91906	Harry	106	" GO ! "
92018	92023	92024	92024	he	106	" Here I come , "
92121	92124	92126	92126	Harry	106	" You ! "
92139	92142	92143	92143	he	170	" Me , "
92147	92160	92143	92143	he	170	" I wondered whether I 'd be meeting you here , Potter . "
92161	92168	92180	92180	his	170	" But I thought -- Snape -- "
92169	92172	92173	92173	Quirrell	170	" Severus ? "
92192	92238	92173	92173	Quirrell	170	" Yes , Severus does seem the type , does n't he ? So useful to have him swooping around like an overgrown bat . Next to him , who would suspect p - p - poor , st - stuttering P - Professor Quirrell ? "
92256	92264	92180	92180	his	170	" But Snape tried to kill me ! "
92265	92341	92180	92180	his	170	" No , no , no . I tried to kill you . Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over as she rushed to set fire to Snape at that Quidditch match . She broke my eye contact with you . Another few seconds and I 'd have got you off that broom . I 'd have managed it before then if Snape had n't been muttering a countercurse , trying to save you . "
92342	92350	92180	92180	his	170	" Snape was trying to save me ? "
92351	92355	92357	92357	Quirrell	170	" Of course , "
92360	92445	92357	92357	Quirrell	170	" \Why do you think he wanted to referee your next match ? He was trying to make sure I did n't do it again . Funny , really ... he need n't have bothered . I could n't do anything with Dumbledore watching . All the other teachers thought Snape was trying to stop Gryffindor from winning , he did make himself unpopular ... and what a waste of time , when after all that , I 'm going to kill you tonight . "
92464	92501	92448	92448	his	170	" You 're too nosy to live , Potter . Scurrying around the school on Halloween like that , for all I knew you 'd seen me coming to look at what was guarding the Stone . "
92502	92509	92448	92448	his	170	" You let the troll in ? "
92510	92596	92448	92448	his	170	" Certainly . I have a special gift with trolls -- you must have seen what I did to the one in the chamber back there ? Unfortunately , while everyone else was running around looking for it , Snape , who already suspected me , went straight to the third floor to head me off -- and not only did my troll fail to beat you to death , that three - headed dog did n't even manage to bite Snape 's leg off properly .
92597	92612	92448	92448	his	170	" Now , wait quietly , Potter . I need to examine this interesting mirror .
92633	92644	92645	92645	Quirrell	170	" This mirror is the key to finding the Stone , "
92655	92684	92649	92649	his	170	" Trust Dumbledore to come up with something like this ... but he 's in London ... I 'll be far away by the time he gets back .... "
92705	92715	92716	92716	he	98	" I saw you and Snape in the forest -- "
92720	92723	92725	92725	Quirrell	170	" Yes , "
92738	92783	92725	92725	Quirrell	170	" He was on to me by that time , trying to find out how far I 'd got . He suspected me all along . Tried to frighten me - as though he could , when I had Lord Voldemort on my side .... "
92798	92817	92784	92784	Quirrell	170	" I see the Stone ... I 'm presenting it to my master ... but where is it ? "
92846	92857	92832	92832	He	98	" But Snape always seemed to hate me so much . "
92858	92864	92866	92866	Quirrell	170	" Oh , he does , "
92869	92899	92866	92866	Quirrell	170	" heavens , yes . He was at Hogwarts with your father , did n't you know ? They loathed each other . But he never wanted you dead . "
92900	92919	92832	92832	He	98	" But I heard you a few days ago , sobbing -- I thought Snape was threatening you .... "
92935	92938	92939	92939	he	170	" Sometimes , "
92942	92963	92939	92939	he	170	" I find it hard to follow my master 's instructions- he is a great wizard and I am weak -- "
92964	92976	92977	92977	Harry	98	" You mean he was there in the classroom with you ? "
92980	92989	92991	92991	Quirrell	170	" He is with me wherever I go , "
92994	93079	92991	92991	Quirrell	170	" I met him when I traveled around the world . A foolish young man I was then , full of ridiculous ideas about good and evil . Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was . There is no good and evil , there is only power , and those too weak to seek it .... Since then , I have served him faithfully , although I have let him down many times . He has had to be very hard on me . "
93084	93123	93080	93080	Quirrell	170	" He does not forgive mistakes easily . When I failed to steal the stone from Gringotts , he was most displeased . He punished me ... decided he would have to keep a closer watch on me .... "
93170	93188	93167	93167	his	170	" I do n't understand ... is the Stone inside the mirror ? Should I break it ? "
93306	93323	93299	93299	He	170	" What does this mirror do ? How does it work ? Help me , Master ! "
93343	93352	93342	93342	himself	170	" Use the boy ... Use the boy ... "
93358	93366	93353	93353	Quirrell	170	" Yes -- Potter -- come here . "
93388	93392	93393	93393	Quirrell	170	" Come here , "
93396	93408	93393	93393	Quirrell	170	" Look in the mirror and tell me what you see . "
93551	93554	93556	93556	Quirrell	170	" Well ? "
93559	93565	93556	93556	Quirrell	170	" What do you see ? "
93572	93581	93582	93582	he	98	" I see myself shaking hands with Dumbledore , "
93585	93597	93582	93582	he	98	" I -- I 've won the house cup for Gryffindor . "
93602	93609	93610	93610	he	170	" Get out of the way , "
93657	93664	93689	93691	The high voice	2303	" He lies ... He lies ... "
93665	93672	93673	93673	Quirrell	170	" Potter , come back here ! "
93676	93688	93673	93673	Quirrell	170	" Tell me the truth ! What did you just see ? "
93695	93708	93689	93691	The high voice	2303	" Let me speak to him ... face - to - face ... "
93709	93718	93689	93691	The high voice	2303	" Master , you are not strong enough ! "
93719	93728	93689	93691	The high voice	2303	" I have strength enough ... for this .... "
93848	93852	93856	93856	Harry	98	" Harry Potter ... "
93870	93877	93856	93856	Harry	98	" See what I have become ? "
93882	93973	93856	93856	Harry	98	" Mere shadow and vapor ... I have form only when I can share another 's body ... but there have always been those willing to let me into their hearts and minds .... Unicorn blood has strengthened me , these past weeks ... you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it for me in the forest ... and once I have the Elixir of Life , I will be able to create a body of my own .... Now ... why do n't you give me that Stone in your pocket ? "
93992	93999	93856	93856	Harry	98	" Do n't be a fool , "
94004	94032	93856	93856	Harry	98	" Better save your own life and join me ... or you 'll meet the same end as your parents .... They died begging me for mercy ... "
94033	94036	94037	94037	Harry	98	" LIAR ! "
94063	94067	93856	93856	Harry	98	" How touching ... "
94071	94131	93856	93856	Harry	98	" I always value bravery ... Yes , boy , your parents were brave .... I killed your father first ; and he put up a courageous fight ... but your mother need n't have died ... she was trying to protect you .... Now give me the Stone , unless you want her to have died in vain . "
94132	94135	94158	94158	Quirrell	170	" NEVER ! "
94146	94150	94144	94144	Voldemort	110	" SEIZE HIM ! "
94250	94257	94259	94259	Voldemort	110	" Seize him ! SEIZE HIM ! "
94305	94320	94322	94322	Quirrell	170	" Master , I can not hold him -- my hands -- my hands ! "
94363	94374	94376	94376	Voldemort	110	" Then kill him , fool , and be done ! "
94402	94405	94389	94389	Harry	98	" AAAARGH ! "
94517	94524	94507	94507	Quirrell	170	" KILL HIM ! KILL HIM ! "
94538	94543	94507	94507	Quirrell	170	" Harry ! Harry ! "
94631	94637	94639	94639	Dumbledore	105	" Good afternoon , Harry , "
94650	94670	94641	94641	Harry	98	" Sir ! The Stone ! It was Quirrell ! He 's got the Stone ! Sir , quick -- "
94671	94686	94688	94688	Dumbledore	105	" Calm yourself , dear boy , you are a little behind the times , "
94690	94698	94688	94688	Dumbledore	105	" Quirrell does not have the Stone . "
94699	94708	94641	94641	Harry	98	" Then who does ? Sir , I -- "
94709	94723	94688	94688	Dumbledore	105	" Harry , please relax , or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out .
94770	94778	94780	94780	Dumbledore	105	" Tokens from your friends and admirers , "
94784	94856	94780	94780	Dumbledore	105	" What happened down in the dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret , so , naturally , the whole school knows . I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible for trying to send you a toilet seat . No doubt they thought it would amuse you . Madam Pomfrey , however , felt it might not be very hygienic , and confiscated it . "
94857	94866	94899	94899	I	0	" How long have I been in here ? "
94867	94892	94780	94780	Dumbledore	105	" Three days . Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round , they have been extremely worried . "
94893	94898	94899	94899	I	0	" But sit , the Stone
94947	94958	94780	94780	Dumbledore	105	" You got there ? You got Hermione 's owl ? "
94959	95004	94899	94899	I	0	" We must have crossed in midair . No sooner had I reached London than it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left . I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off you . "
95005	95010	94780	94780	Dumbledore	105	" It was you . "
95011	95020	94899	94899	I	0	" I feared I might be too late . "
95021	95038	94780	94780	Dumbledore	105	" You nearly were , I could n't have kept him off the Stone much longer -- "
95039	95077	94899	94899	I	0	" Not the Stone , boy , you -- the effort involved nearly killed you . For one terrible moment there , I was afraid it had . As for the Stone , it has been destroyed . "
95078	95081	95083	95083	Harry	98	" Destroyed ? "
95086	95094	95083	95083	Harry	98	" But your friend -- Nicolas Flamel -- "
95095	95103	95105	95105	Dumbledore	105	" Oh , you know about Nicolas ? "
95111	95143	95105	95105	Dumbledore	105	" You did do the thing properly , did n't you ? Well , Nicolas and I have had a little chat , and agreed it 's all for the best . "
95144	95159	94899	94899	I	0	" But that means he and his wife will die , wo n't they ? "
95160	95181	95105	95105	Dumbledore	105	" They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then , yes , they will die . "
95194	95302	95303	95303	Harry	98	" To one as young as you , I 'm sure it seems incredible , but to Nicolas and Perenelle , it really is like going to bed after a very , very long day . After all , to the well - organized mind , death is but the next great adventure . You know , the Stone was really not such a wonderful thing . As much money and life as you could want ! The two things most human beings would choose above all -- the trouble is , humans do have a knack of choosing precisely those things that are worst for them . "
95321	95324	95326	95326	Harry	98	" Sir ? "
95328	95353	95326	95326	Harry	98	" I 've been thinking ... sir -- even if the Stone 's gone , Vol- , I mean , You - Know- Who -- "
95354	95380	95303	95303	Harry	98	" Call him Voldemort , Harry . Always use the proper name for things . Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself . "
95381	95414	95326	95326	Harry	98	" Yes , sir . Well , Voldemort 's going to try other ways of coming back , is n't he ? I mean , he has n't gone , has he ? "
95415	95522	95303	95303	Harry	98	" No , Harry , he has not . He is still out there somewhere , perhaps looking for another body to share ... not being truly alive , he can not be killed . He left Quirrell to die ; he shows just as little mercy to his followers as his enemies . Nevertheless , Harry , while you may only have delayed his return to power , it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time -- and if he is delayed again , and again , why , he may never return to power . "
95541	95570	95538	95538	he	98	" Sir , there are some other things I 'd like to know , if you can tell me ... things I want to know the truth about .... "
95571	95575	95576	95576	Dumbledore	105	" The truth . "
95579	95633	95576	95576	Dumbledore	105	" It is a beautiful and terrible thing , and should therefore be treated with great caution . However , I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to , in which case I beg you 'll forgive me . I shall not , of course , lie . "
95634	95668	95538	95538	he	98	" Well ... Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me . But why would he want to kill me in the first place ? "
95676	95737	95538	95538	he	98	" Alas , the first thing you ask me , I can not tell you . Not today . Not now . You will know , one day ... put it from your mind for now , Harry . When you are older ... I know you hate to hear this ... when you are ready , you will know . "
95749	95758	95538	95538	he	98	" But why could n't Quirrell touch me ? "
95759	95877	95538	95538	he	98	" Your mother died to save you . If there is one thing Voldemort can not understand , it is love . He did n't realize that love as powerful as your mother 's for you leaves its own mark . Not a scar , no visible sign ... to have been loved so deeply , even though the person who loved us is gone , will give us some protection forever . It is in your very skin . Quirrell , full of hatred , greed , and ambition , sharing his soul with Voldemort , could not touch you for this reason . It was agony to touch a person marked by something so good . "
95914	95929	95911	95911	Harry	98	" And the invisibility cloak - do you know who sent it to me ? "
95930	95951	95952	95952	Dumbledore	105	" Ah - your father happened to leave it in my possession , and I thought you might like it . "
95957	95980	95952	95952	Dumbledore	105	" Useful things ... your father used it mainly for sneaking off to the kitchens to steal food when he was here . "
95981	95988	95911	95911	Harry	98	" And there 's something else ... "
95989	95993	95952	95952	Dumbledore	105	" Fire away . "
95994	95999	95911	95911	Harry	98	" Quirrell said Snape -- "
96000	96006	95952	95952	Dumbledore	105	" Professor Snape , Harry . "
96007	96027	95911	95911	Harry	98	" Yes , him -- Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father . Is that true ? "
96028	96057	95952	95952	Dumbledore	105	" Well , they did rather detest each other . Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy . And then , your father did something Snape could never forgive . "
96058	96061	95911	95911	Harry	98	" What ? "
96062	96068	95952	95952	Dumbledore	105	" He saved his life . "
96069	96072	95911	95911	Harry	98	" What ? "
96073	96076	96078	96078	Dumbledore	105	" Yes ... "
96081	96145	96078	96078	Dumbledore	105	" Funny , the way people 's minds work , is n't it ? Professor Snape could n't bear being in your father 's debt .... I do believe he worked so hard to protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even . Then he could go back to hating your father 's memory in peace .... "
96162	96172	96159	96159	he	98	" And sir , there 's one more thing ... "
96173	96178	95911	95911	Harry	98	" Just the one ? "
96179	96191	96159	96159	he	98	" How did I get the Stone out of the mirror ? "
96192	96342	95911	95911	Harry	98	" Ah , now , I 'm glad you asked me that . It was one of my more brilliant ideas , and between you and me , that 's saying something . You see , only one who wanted to find the Stone -- find it , but not use it -- would be able to get it , otherwise they 'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of Life . My brain surprises even me sometimes .... Now , enough questions . I suggest you make a start on these sweets . Ah ! Bettie Bott 's Every Flavor Beans ! I was unfortunate enough in my youth to come across a vomitflavored one , and since then I 'm afraid I 've rather lost my liking for them -- but I think I 'll be safe with a nice toffee , do n't you ? "
96362	96368	96357	96357	he	2308	" Alas ! Ear wax ! "
96384	96389	96390	96390	Harry	98	" Just five minutes , "
96393	96397	96372	96373	the nurse	2309	" Absolutely not . "
96398	96405	96372	96373	the nurse	2309	" You let Professor Dumbledore in ... "
96406	96424	96372	96373	the nurse	2309	" Well , of course , that was the headmaster , quite different . You need rest . "
96425	96445	96372	96373	the nurse	2309	" I am resting , look , lying down and everything . Oh , go on , Madam Pomfrey ... "
96446	96452	96453	96453	she	111	" Oh , very well , "
96456	96462	96453	96453	she	111	" But five minutes only . "
96471	96474	96464	96464	she	111	" Harry ! "
96502	96519	96490	96490	she	220	" Oh , Harry , we were sure you were going to -- Dumbledore was so worried- "
96520	96529	96531	96531	Ron	194	" The whole school 's talking about it , "
96533	96538	96531	96531	Ron	194	" What really happened ? "
96611	96618	96620	96620	Ron	194	" So the Stone 's gone ? "
96623	96631	96620	96620	Ron	194	" Flamel 's just going to die ? "
96632	96664	96606	96606	Hermione	220	" That 's what I said , but Dumbledore thinks that -- what was it ? -- ' to the well - organized mind , death is but the next great adventure .
96665	96675	96677	96677	Ron	194	" I always said he was off his rocker , "
96689	96697	96699	96699	Harry	98	" So what happened to you two ? "
96701	96710	96712	96712	Hermione	220	" Well , I got back all right , "
96714	96773	96712	96712	Hermione	220	" I brought Ron round -- that took a while -- and we were dashing up to the owlery to contact Dumbledore when we met him in the entrance hall -- he already knew -- he just said , ' Harry 's gone after him , has n't he ? ' and hurtled off to the third floor . "
96774	96784	96786	96786	Ron	194	" D'you think he meant you to do it ? "
96788	96798	96786	96786	Ron	194	" Sending you your father 's cloak and everything ? "
96799	96802	96803	96803	Hermione	220	" Well , "
96806	96824	96803	96803	Hermione	220	" if he did -- I mean to say that 's terrible- you could have been killed . "
96825	96832	96834	96834	Harry	98	" No , it is n't , "
96837	96937	96834	96834	Harry	98	" He 's a funny man , Dumbledore . I think he sort of wanted to give me a chance . I think he knows more or less everything that goes on here , you know . I reckon he had a pretty good idea we were going to try , and instead of stopping us , he just taught us enough to help . I do n't think it was an accident he let me find out how the mirror worked . It 's almost like he thought I had the right to face Voldemort if I could .... "
96938	96950	96952	96952	Ron	194	" Yeah , Dumbledore 's off his rocker , all right , "
96955	97007	96952	96952	Ron	194	" Listen , you 've got to be up for the end - of - year feast tomorrow . The points are all in and Slytherin won , of course -- you missed the last Quidditch match , we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you -- but the food'll be good . "
97017	97027	97028	97028	she	111	" You 've had nearly fifteen minutes , now OUT "
97054	97074	97046	97046	I	0	" he told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened his many candy boxes . I can , ca n't I ? "
97075	97087	97088	97088	she	111	" Professor Dumbledore says you are to be allowed to go , "
97108	97115	97088	97088	she	111	" And you have another visitor . "
97116	97121	97123	97123	Harry	98	" Oh , good , "
97125	97130	97123	97123	Harry	98	" Who is it ? "
97173	97185	97186	97186	he	284	" It 's -- all -- my -- ruddy -- fault ! "
97257	97257	97254	97255	a Muggle	439	"
97258	97261	97263	97263	Harry	284	" Hagrid ! "
97283	97314	97280	97280	his	284	" Hagrid , he 'd have found out somehow , this is Voldemort we 're talking about , he 'd have found out even if you had n't told him . "
97315	97321	97323	97323	Hagrid	284	" Yeh could 've died ! "
97325	97334	97323	97323	Hagrid	284	" An ' don ' say the name ! "
97335	97338	97339	97339	Harry	284	" VOLDEMORT ! "
97352	97397	97348	97348	he	284	" I 've met him and I 'm calling him by his name . Please cheer up , Hagrid , we saved the Stone , it 's gone , he ca n't use it . Have a Chocolate Frog , I 've got loads .... "
97411	97423	97398	97398	Hagrid	284	" That reminds me . I 've got yeh a present . "
97424	97435	97437	97437	Harry	284	" It 's not a stoat sandwich , is it ? "
97449	97478	97443	97443	Hagrid	284	" Nah . Dumbledore gave me the day off yesterday ter fix it . ' Course , he shoulda sacked me instead -- anyway , got yeh this ... "
97517	97546	97515	97515	father	540	" Sent owls off ter all yer parents ' old school friends , askin ' fer photos ... knew yeh didn ' have any ... d'yeh like it ? "
97704	97709	97710	97710	Dumbledore	115	" Another year gone ! "
97714	97772	97710	97710	Dumbledore	115	" And I must trouble you with an old man 's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth into our delicious feast . What a year it has been ! Hopefully your heads are all a little fuller than they were ... you have the whole summer ahead to get them nice and empty before next year starts ....
97773	97837	97710	97710	Dumbledore	115	" Now , as I understand it , the house cup here needs awarding , and the points stand thus : In fourth place , Gryffindor , with three hundred and twelve points ; in third , Hufflepuff , with three hundred and fifty - two ; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty - six and Slytherin , four hundred and seventy- two . "
